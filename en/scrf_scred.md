# SourceCred and SCRF
A good starting point to understand the history of SourceCred at SCRF is the main [Implementing SourceCred on the Forum](https://www.smartcontractresearch.org/t/implementing-sourcecred-on-the-forum/1295) topic. 

> “This tool allows a community to identify and incentivize online behaviors through reward mechanisms. As a community dedicated to connecting industry and academia in the web3 space, it seems appropriate that we implement web3 tools that allow us to accomplish our mission of facilitating and rewarding long-tail discussion and thoughtful contributions in the web3 research space.” 
> - Paul Zube, Engagement Head SCRF

## How to Participate
In order to earn Cred simply create an account at the [SCRF Forum](https://www.smartcontractresearch.org/) and start contributing. All of the likes you give, likes you get, content you create, and content that gets shared will earn you Cred. Then, every month SCRF releases an amount of DAI to the community according to the earned Cred Rank. 

More information about how SourceCred calculates Cred can be found in the following SCRF presentations.
- [SourceCred - Node and Edge Weights](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1C2AjRJyujYJvccnChtWzw-0Ox83AQLy60Jp8FnWu6Eo/edit?usp=sharing)
- [SCRF SourceCred Community Vote](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Mnx6bwN_HV8bhFkYDBtcDN8_wCfCHLbxlBRKRCIJY_k/edit?usp=sharing)

### Opting In
Before you can Opt In to receive a DAI payment it is required that the First Time Opt In Form be completed. This form only needs to be filled out once. Please ensure that the wallet address supplied is compatible with DAI.
- [First Time Opt In Form](https://forms.gle/36iaJNrBAcCqLj3B9)

Each month you must Opt In. Please do so on the SCRF Discord Server 
- [#💲sourcecred-opt-in channel](https://discord.com/channels/784234332617048065/968202164247879730)

### Tracking CredRank
At the end of each month the monthly [CredRank Logs](https://github.com/smartcontractresearchforum/docs/blob/main/en/scrf_scred.md#credrank-logs) section of this document will be updated.

## Monthly Payouts
Each month, SCRF releases 5,000 DAI which is distributed to the community members who opt-in. Individual payouts are calculated based on Cred Rank and the amount of unclaimed DAI. 

DAI that would go to members who do not opt-in are returned to a shared pool of DAI. This shared pool is distributed amongst those who opt-in. 

For the month of May 2022, the calculations used were based on the [SCRF - SourceCred Poll Results and Whats Next](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nkhX9kZv-coVmsxCyBzkZEYIfzNj-DZdRfbNW0Wbgdk/edit?usp=sharing) presentation. 

Future methods of calculating individual DAI amounts are open for discussion in the monthly SCRF Community Committee meeting.
