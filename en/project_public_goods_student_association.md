# Public Goods Student Association Overview

## SCRF Overview

[SCRF](https://scrf.io/)'s bold mission is to bring together researchers and builders to create groundbreaking web3 advancements. To succeed in this quest, SCRF facilitates resource and knowledge exchange, sponsors projects, and constructs collaborative forums. The org comprises an active international network of academics, industry architects, and blockchain advocates.

SCRF was founded roughly two years ago and has supported research curation and discussion since then. [The forum](https://smartcontractresearch.org/) was launched early in 2021, and SCRF released the [Research Pulse](https://scrf.substack.com/), a list of curated research from 300+ resources weekly since February 2021.

## Project Overview

### Goal

The goal of this project is to bring together students from around the world to learn about public goods and to contribute towards solving the biggest problems.

### Problem

There are currently no organized onboarding pathways for students to get into public goods or to have any kind of structured learning pathway as they explore the various challenges pertaining to public goods.

There are many organizations interested in supporting education, development, or research on public goods, but there aren't easy ways to connect with many clubs.

### Proposed Project

The SCRF team wants to build out the global Public Goods Student Association as a space for students to connect with others interested in these topics, learn from experts, and have opportunities to get directly involved in new or existing projects.

To accomplish this, the SCRF team will:

* Reach out to 50+ universities globally
* Organize a weekly seminar starting in January 2023
* Run an ideation event in early February 2023
* Set up a virtual 6-8 week hackathon, targeting Spring 2023
* Create repositories of open problems, bounties, and job opportunities
* Hire interns to help manage and grow the various activities

### What are Public Goods?

This is by no means a comprehensive explanation, but below are some pointers to get started.

Public goods refer to things that are [nonexcludable and nonrivalrous](https://www.lawinsider.com/dictionary/nonexcludable).
