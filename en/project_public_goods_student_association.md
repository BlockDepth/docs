# Public Goods Student Association Overview

## Overview

The Public Goods Student Association (PGSA) is an initiative from SCRF, supported by Gitcoin and Lobby3 DAO, meant to bring together students from around the world who want to learn more about public goods but aren't sure where to get started. From March 16-April 27, there will be a weekly virtual seminar open to any students who want to delve into specific public goods topics. In addition to these weekly sessions, the PGSA will support the creation of various materials (such as reading lists or curricula) to help guide students in their learning journey. 

Beyond this Spring, the PGSA will partner with appropriate hackathon groups over the summer to provide a pathway for students to apply their knowledge by building the future of public goods. For the 2023-2024 Academic Year, the PGSA will partner with a variety of student groups around the world to build more educational materials and resources around the various topics that fall under the bucket of public goods.

## Resources

### What are Public Goods?

This is by no means a comprehensive explanation, but below are some pointers to get started. The PGSA project team will continuie to update this as we gather more resources. 

Public goods refer to things that are [nonexcludable and nonrivalrous](https://www.lawinsider.com/dictionary/nonexcludable). Here's a [Khan Academy link](https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/microeconomics/market-failure-and-the-role-of-government/externalities-topic/a/public-goods-cnx) and a [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy link](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/public-goods/) for more context and a talk from [Vitalik on the subject of funding public goods](https://protocol.ai/blog/transcription-vitalik-buterin-funding-the-commons/).
