**[0:07]	Eugene Leventhal:** Hello, and welcome to today's episode of SCRF Interviews. This is the first episode in our first miniseries on governance, and we're specifically gonna be exploring the intersection of culture and incentives and how those questions impact governance overall in centralized ecosystems. And I'm really excited and thankful to get to kick off this miniseries with Abbey Titcomb from Radicle and Nathan Schneider from CU Boulder. And I'll give each one of you a moment to introduce yourselves, and then we can jump right into the conversation. 

So, Abbey, do you mind kicking us off with a quick intro?

**[0:40] Abbey Titcomb:** Not at all. Thanks for having me. My name's Abbey, I'm the head of community at Radicle. Radicle is a web3 network for collaboration; specifically, it provides developers with a decentralized way to collaborate on code together. It's a hybrid crypto project. On one hand, it's a hardcore peer-to-peer network built on top of Git, that allows people to host and share git repositories with each other. And on the other hand, it's a light Ethereum integration that allows developers to use cryptoeconomic primitives, like multisigs and NFTs to coordinate open-source development and fund their open-source work.

**[1:25] Eugene:** Great. Thank you for sharing. And Nathan, do you mind giving us a quick bio before we get the conversation going? 

**[1:29] Nathan Schneider:** Sure. I'm Nathan Schneider. I'm a professor of media studies at the University of Colorado Boulder, and I run the Media Enterprise Design Lab here. We do work on democratic ownership and governance, ranging from, you know, old school cooperatives and news organizations and things like that to crypto projects. And I've been involved in conversations and research on crypto governance ever since I first read the Ethereum whitepaper in early 2014 and had my mind blown, like a bunch of other people, about the possibilities. And it's been really fun over the last few years to see some of those possibilities in their utopian and dystopian forms start to become realities. 

**[2:21] Eugene:** Yeah, and I'm excited to get right into the question of what some of these realities, what role the very frequently ephemeral element of culture can play in these environments. So, yeah, I'd love to just start with the direct question of what role do you see culture playing in decentralized ecosystems?

**[2:39] Abbey:** I can take a stab at that first. I think that culture is almost everything for decentralized systems. I think that similar to the free- and open-source movement, one driven by the culture of free software, not free as in free beer, but free as in free freedom, is that culture drives technological movements. And in web3, the culture of decentralization and liberation and freedom in the form of personal control, trust, don't trust, verify, right? That's what, if I'm getting the slogan right, is the ethos that is driving a wave of new technology. And so I think that this ideological culture, which is something that builders and creators can opt into, is something that drives technology that challenges traditional institutions that have defined mainstream culture.

So specifically, with the web3 movements, it's challenging. The centralized platforms that have built their corporations and have driven our day-to-day online experience with certain values of centralization of trust and of extraction and in the same way that technology has embedded those values within mainstream culture. Web3 is using these alternative culture drivers to bring forth a new wave of technology. And so I think that culture is incredibly important for being able to not only do the hard thing, which is build against traditional systems but keep developing new technology that can steward new futures within the vision of the internet

**[4:36] Nathan:** Don't trust, verify, that, I think, is an interesting one because it is part of this culture, for sure, almost to a fault, almost to excess, beyond necessity. People are trying to build in these systems that, even when there's just a few people using them, that are scalable to people that they don't have to trust. At the same time, I'm always interested in the respect in which people are in fact using culture as a means of trust and using these kinds of cultural signals and signposts as culture has always been used to cultivate a sense of, okay, we're in the same team, we're on the same mission here, we can trust each other, while we try to figure out how to make this system work.

And I think there's an important respect there, in which trust is this necessary glue that allows projects to get going and to have some traction and some growth and development in a context where not everything has been figured out. And that has to be okay. We have to be able to work without having figured everything out. And so when you look at, the meme culture of crypto projects, when you look at just the words, there's so much jargon that has to be explained. The religion of Moloch  Moloch, this whole kind of network of systems, that when I present this stuff to my students, I have to unpack like so much language that is embedded in this culture. 

**6:16** And language in this context, as in so many other human contexts, serves as a kind of glue. If you know the language, you're somebody who, there's more likelihood that you can trust this person to do a bunch of other things that you yourself would wanna do. Because you both have taken the time to learn this shared language. So it also provides this means of actually enabling people to trust before they can verify. 

**[6:44] Abbey:** I really love that point because it really is describing lore. Like there is this kind of like shared crypto lore within different ecosystems that people subscribe to and align their own values with. And I think that this is also why we’ve seen differences between different crypto ecosystems and tribalism between the two is that you actually see this natural inclination to people who share certain values outside of their work. And you find that that’s actually deeply powerful because the values of the people building the technology become embedded in the technology itself. 

And so, it’s the trust, right? That keeps people building things in uncertain territory, but it's also very powerful because now you have the ability to influence the technology that you're designing. And I think that’s very much so what we're seeing as, the crypto space right now, although there's a lot of mainstream aspects of it generated and defined by their hype count, you know. There's also like a lot of really great experimentation right now where people are just throwing things at the wall, sticking, and then forking and doing something else. And so you see that the culture of crypto is also compounded on the open source sharing that came before it. 

**8:11** And so there's like a lot of embedded lore that has meme’d itself into reality and is now taking shape. I think we're finally seeing certain things take shape as people start to use, and start to, well, I think some people would argue if it's actually being used, but I think we're really starting to see some of those values and culture take shape as crypto starts becoming more mainstream.

**[8:36] Nathan:** And I mean that question about what are people using is so central to this. Like, what is it other than culture, in so many projects that is making people even bother to use this stuff? I mean in some cases, I think there are moments where, okay, there's a thing or two, you can do that, you can't do without this tool, but in a lot of cases, adoption is nudged by culture. I'm adopting this tool because I have a cultural commitment to doing things this way, rather than that way. To using Radicle rather than GitHub. And the culture again, drives participation in a way that the pure logic of economic incentives and technical protocols and particular affordances of systems, which people are working toward and trying to build nevertheless are themselves insufficient.

**[9:36] Abbey:** And a perfect example of that, which is actually kind of non-crypto related is Linus Torvalds. And the reason that he built Git was because, he built Git which is a distributed version control system, an open-source distributed version control system, in retaliation, because a distributed version control system that he was using to develop Linux became closed-source, he had to start paying for it. And so as an engineer, a Linux engineer actually reverse-engineered that distributed version control protocol, and thus Git was born, which is probably the most widely used version control system that drives all open-source software development of today. 

**10:19** 	And so you see that these, like, larger ideological decisions define culture, and then that culture compounds on itself and becomes things that are like very real, that then are able to trigger externalities that I guess you could say are kind of like side of culture. They drive adoption; they create markets and so on.

**[10:42] Nathan:** And Git is a really interesting example because it's something, I've tried to understand; I've been doing research on like, what are the governance biases in different technologies that people use to collaborate, and Git is a fascinating one because it is, in some respects, a total power vacuum. The way Git is set up, it doesn't tell you who has permissions over a certain codebase. You download it, you can do whatever you want with it, you can fork the thing, and you can run with it. And it's an extremely, it dictates so little about how power flows in a community of users. And as a result, it means that it turns to those users’ culture and other technical practices that they might use in order to layer on top of it.

**11:39** Okay. How are we going to actually govern this shared asset? And this is the case with a lot of technologies, but then you look at some of the GitHub, which then does layer on a permission system and says, okay, we're gonna have a top-down permission system. And this is how we're gonna govern Git. Lots of times, it's an email list. In the case of the Linux project itself, that Git was first created for, there was already a culture built of a certain kind of very blunt and kind of, so-called meritocratic relationship with a single founder who still holds a kind of dictatorship role in it. 

And it's interesting how in that case, a lot of that is not dictated by the technology, but a culture that formed around it. And then you see a project like Python using a lot of the same tools that had a similar kind of dictator relationship and then has had to transition into other kinds of cultural and governance practices around that same technology.

**[12:48] Eugene:** And so I guess a question responding to both of you then, is sort of in the process of, if you're in charge of planning or building, or you're just happening to launch a new DAO or doing anything where you have to now think of the governance aspects that are relevant to the goal that you're trying to accomplish. When is the right time to start thinking about culture? Or if you're asking yourself the question, is it too late, because it already started before and now you're just trying to figure out where it's at and what it means? And so the chicken and the egg problem with culture, it seems like the starting point is always very challenging. I don't know, do you see it as emergent?

**[13:22] Abbey:** I would say it's in part emergent, but it needs active thought and deliberation because very quickly culture can appear. Because I do think culture is multidimensional. I'll say this first. I think that what we just spoke about was ideological culture. The reason why; what drives a movement, decentralization, liberation, like freedom, but there's also like working culture. And I think that this is how people work together, how people create together, how people communicate. And I think that working culture sometimes is more impactful on a project's overall culture than the ideological culture itself. 

And I think that two people can share values and subscribe to a certain ideological culture, but have vastly different means of working culture. And if they're contributing and driving, working culture, then I think that you'll see, not a schism because it's not always binary, but you'll see certain values emerge through the way that the community is interacting with each other. 

**14:38** And so I think that to combat, I mean in combat I would say harmful culture, I guess which is again a very subjective process, for me to do that, I've been trying to subscribe to openness and accessibility as two driving values of working culture within the Radicle project. And so if you're able to have a mandate of a project's working culture, you're able to craft the spaces within the project, you're able to lay the social infrastructure and design it in a way that is welcoming and encourages working culture within those values. And I really do think that like openness and accessibility are two of like the biggest drivers within open-source communities in general.

And I know that when starting to design Radicle’s infrastructure, there was a lot of reading and trying to understand how and what best practices to subscribe to were, to ensure that we're creating an open and accessible space for this culture to develop. So I think it's half and half. I think you have to be thinking about [culture] from the start and you have to be at least evaluating what culture exists and understanding as if there is a certain vision for where we want culture to go. But it's also incredibly emergent and there needs to be kind of more active evaluation in space to be reflecting on what that culture is and how it's contributing to a project’s success or sustainability.

**[16:20] Nathan:** Yeah. What you're saying there reminds me of the story of the Contributor Covenant, which is a widely used code of conduct in open-source projects, where Coraline Ehmke among many other people experienced, really kind of hostile behavior in open-source spaces. And this was particularly an issue around gender and sexual harassment. And there was a sense of emergent culture in a lot of these communities that was very strong. But these communities were very male-dominated. And so many of the people in positions of power just did not experience or see or have to viscerally confront what was going on. 

And yet they had this feeling that we have a strong culture, we can handle this stuff. We don’t need more rules. We don’t need more intentional crafting. We don’t wanna lose that emergent quality. And Coraline and others just insisted, no, we need to make codes of conduct explicit. I'm not gonna go to a conference that doesn't have a code of conduct that protects me explicitly against certain kinds of abuse that I've experienced. And it was a point of incredible tension for a long time, right? Where communities just did not want to, their leaders did not want to do the work of making cultural norms explicit. 

**17:55** And finally, there's been a kind of ongoing process where people have been waking up to recognize that is actually, it doesn't work that way. It's not gonna happen. And these kinds of abuses need to be confronted explicitly. We need to be intentional. And open source has been and free software, in particular, the Free Software Foundation is an example of this, a place that has harbored a lot of abusive practices and has resisted efforts to do that explicit community cultivation. But at the same time that community, or that Contributor Covenant that Coraline Ada Ehmke designed, has now been very, very widely adopted across many, many projects, including Linux and many others that had been kind of havens of abusive behavior. 

**18:50** 	In the crypto world, one case that comes to mind too, is one that I've been studying as part of my work on cryptoeconomics, which is 1hive, which is a DAO that is building a lot of tools for other DAOs and sort of thing and has a really vibrant community. And I was really running in my early writing on it on the basis of things that it said on the website. For instance, you go to the about page and it says, “Honey is money.” Honey is the name of their token. And you look at the main, 1hive.org. It's like, you see charts, you see like things relating to economic flows. 

**19:30** 	So I thought, okay, wow, this is a community that is really focused on its economic logics and its economic flows. And then I write this and share drafts and people in that community are like, “no, no, no, no” you're totally misunderstanding how we think of ourselves. And that was a really interesting disconnect to encounter, where the people involved see it as a culture that is very detached from the kind of incentivization of everything and kind of economic rewards, even though a lot of the stuff that happens to end up on the websites when you arrive gives one that impression.

**20:17** And so that’s another danger I think, of not kind of intentionally crafting that culture. At the same time, there’s something so powerful and dynamic about the spontaneous cultures that emerge in these communities. And so it’s always a balance of how do you make sure to honor that spontaneity and that unpredictability, while also when it really comes down to it, the most important questions are, how do you make people safe? And how do you make sure that the edge cases that really matter for everything and how does that determine who’s gonna come in and who’s gonna be driven out, who’s gonna get hurt is really at the center of how you craft the culture.

**[21:17] Abbey:** Yeah. And to double click on the Covenant right? These materials become standardized in a way that they can be cloned and used in any project. And I think that that's incredibly powerful to be able to be presented with something that resembles an ideological culture that you and your project want to subscribe to. And you're able to do that communally by adopting a standard, which is a very powerful way to collectively, not just as an individual, like as an individual project, but to collectively subscribe to a culture. And I think we see a lot of that happening ad hoc, kind of in the crypto space because it's so new and so emergent. But I think that focusing on how to develop those best practices within governance, things that can be easily shared and forked and cloned from project to project that are ways to express values are really powerful.

**22:04** And on the other side, I think that really culture rears its head, people realize that there's a culture issue or what a culture is when conflicts arise. Do you know what I mean? It's kind of hard to evaluate a culture when everything's okay. And you don't really evaluate those issues until you have these conflicts, whether they may be social conflicts, or I think more and more we'll see crypto projects dealing with the nature of their financialization and stakeholder interests versus social interests. 

Because I think that one of the most powerful drivers of culture, of course, are the people contributing to a project. And I think that a great way to define and cultivate culture is to have someone who's directly focused on that, community managers, developers, evangelists, these roles are actually people who become embedded in the culture of the project that they're contributing to and are able to craft and cultivate the one-on-one relationships between contributors and manage conflicts between contributors and maintainers if we're looking at it in a traditional open-source sense. 

**23:10** But more and more, I think what's interesting is that—and what I think of when Nathan, you were talking about it—I was thinking about the recent MakerDAO drama that happened in the Discord forum, where you're starting to see social conflicts arise in governance processes and are being evaluated, technically evaluated within the processes that are laid out within an organization and starting to see that it's really hard to actually deal with some of these conflicts. This specific conflict I'm mentioning is one of the founders of MakerDAO, a large Maker holder, suggesting to offboard a Maker contributor via a governance proposal in the forum. And a lot of participants in governance say, “Is this how this is supposed to happen?”

**24:01** And then trying to grapple with this approach and trying to contextualize and understand how this is actually supposed to happen, knowing that this is something that potentially stakeholders who are financially incentivized would be willing to do. And so I think that more and more as these protocol ecosystems mature, we'll start to see these conflicts that are probably going to be very closely related to stakeholder incentives rear their head. And we're going to have to, and culture is kind of the only real way in the social infrastructure that drives, culture is gonna be the only real way to create systems that can remain resilient to those external motivations.

**[24:44] Nathan:** Something you said there too about the cloning of rules is, is really important. I mean, this is something that we see in offline life a lot, corporate boards, community organizations, resemble each other. If you look at the bylaws of lots of different kinds of civic organizations, they’re more similar than different right?. And I think part of that is actually cultural, the reason is that I kind of use, as a rule of thumb, that 80% of governance is culture and only 20% is the rules. And the trouble is if every rule set is different, people come into this space, not knowing what culture to build on top of that. 

Whereas if you have some uniformity, then people come in, they know most of the norms that are built on top of those rules and they can start operating and there might be some small differences from organization to organization, but that sense of the recognition that culture is kind of, governance culture is a protocol that has to be able to translate across multiple organizations, especially when you think about the aspiration of say being a member of like dozens of DAOs. If we're gonna live our lives in these like ownership relationships that cascade across our different domains of interest and economic life.

**26:16**We're gonna have to participate in multiple organizations. And that means not just attending to the culture of that organization, but actually, how do we cultivate kind of shared understandings across organizations so that people can more or less easily move from one to the other. That's also a challenge. And I think it's also a reason you see a lot of forking in crypto. And in addition to being able to build on the technical benefits of a certain protocol, you know you're able to say, okay, we may not like everything that Compound did, but at least it's a known known. At least we know how it works and we know basically how to do it and we can build from there. 

**[27:04] Abbey:** It really makes me think about the question that we just mentioned earlier, which is when what we’re forking are smart contracts, when what we’re forking are technical governance primitives, and we're employing these governance networks and cryptoeconomic systems that have inherent values that are embedded in them. How does one upgrade? And I think about this a lot, which is, I truly believe that token voting is actually an unsustainable means, a governance system for protocol, open-source protocol ecosystems in the long term. And that there will be a lot of these protocol ecosystems, that will either upgrade or supplement governance with more modularized systems that can also be based in cryptoeconomic primitives, like NFTs, or will be complete upheavals of how a system is governed in the first place. 

**27:57** But I'm so interested and I really don't have an answer to this question, but it's one that I'm thinking about a lot, is how do you design a strategy? How do you design a culture, and how do you design the social infrastructure, that allows for the reevaluation of governance strategies? And I think I have a hunch that it's about continuously distributing influence. And so having a mechanism of a continuously distributing governing power to empower the people who are driving the project forward, but it's really hard to know about how, and to think, and to imagine kind of how we see governance evolving in progressively decentralizing systems as they mature.

**[28:42] Eugene:** Yeah. And the general question that I kind of wanted to come in with or the angle to highlight is sort of: what additional challenges exist given that, especially given how prevalent token voting models are, as of today, that there are these inherent links between, hey, you wanna vote, but you’re thinking also: if you hustle, can you get really rich one day? And so what complications does that add to being a good community participant? And unintentionally, does that inherent structure incentivize people to just want to exit? And that as soon as you're not happy, and if you have a way to hard fork that you like a little more and you think can get you, decent return over time, is that the calculus that people are making or is that only a certain subset? And I love the 80-20 culture split and I would hope that 80% of humanity is more focused on culture than processes, but I don't know if that's actually the case. Are people more worried about how their wallet is looking as opposed to the real culture and meaning and values of an ecosystem?

**[29:40] Abbey:** I think about this all the time. It's also how does financialization drive culture in the long term, if early contributors are cashing out and leaving a project, what does that mean for the culture of the project that they created? And the rest of the holders and the stakeholders involved in the project. And I think that this is kind of an awkward conversation for a lot of people in crypto because like, hot take, I think a lot of people, the fact of getting rich is actually almost part of an ideological culture as well. Like I think that a lot, and of what we've seen, and I'm kind of waiting for more case studies on this: but are you going to hold your airdrop? Are you going to sell it to pay for your real-world bills?

**30:26** These airdrops, which are signifying what governing power in emergent networks are going to be, you know what I mean, like also looked at in their monetary value. And so I think that there’s kind of an awkward relationship with protocol governance when it relates to tokens because there is this underlying subliminal financial incentive that is driving decisions. And I think that in the long term, we’ll start to see the relationship with stakeholders change as people start to cash out. Because again, a lot of these protocol ecosystems have investors who have to take returns.

**31:04** And so when that time comes, how does a system and a network and a governing network remain resilient to those inevitable financial actions? In the same way that we ask, what, how will our centralized platforms remain resilient to the eventual extraction that the profit incentive models that the corporations were driven by are aligned with? And so I think that this is something that I would love to hear more people’s thoughts and people have thought about this and what will happen because I really don't know. And I think it's something that definitely keeps me up at night. 


**[31:38] Nathan:** I think you need to figure out those non-economic spaces. And it is a self-fulfilling prophecy. I mean, if we design all of our systems around economic nudges, we are going to become economically nudged. Our receptors are gonna change. This is something people in psychology have recognized. We've done generations of psychological research on college students in the United States of America. And it turns out if you compare that work to studies on college students in Sub-Saharan Africa; you see very different psychological patterns because of the culture in which they exist. Because there is less of a kind of individualist culture that they've grown up in. And so their receptors, the ways in which they receive information in the world and process it is becomes different.

**32:39** And we run that risk. I mean, that's the kind of metaphysical risk of, like, what are we doing to our humanity when everything is built on these incentives? But kind of short term, too, if I compare my, like, centralized commercial, social media feed, web 2.0 feed, with the web3 feeds and these kinds of fledgling social platforms, like I'll take the web 2.0 any day. The web3 feeds are full of this, like, short term is like token shilling. Because even if they're not shilling a token in the content, they're responding to incentive structures where they actually stand to gain economically from something they say. In web 2, at least there was this because while these companies are extracting and manipulating their users, they're trying to disguise the economics of the platform, and as much as we might dislike that, it does at least create a world in which people feel like they are, many people, not the kind of manipulators, but the 80%, feel that they are engaged in a purely social space and you see people pouring their hearts out in ways that just like have no economic calculus whatsoever. 


**34:03** 	And those are the kinds of beautiful moments in my view, in social media, by and large. And so we just see in that kind of crass short-term way, the way in which economic incentives can really harm culture. I mean I think over and over of like the old classic anthropology of the gift. The idea is that if you put a price on a gift, it ceases to be a gift. And of course, there is an economy of gifts. If grandma gives my kids a gift, we have to write that thank you note, or else we're in big trouble. There is reciprocity, there is a set of expectations, but if I were to send grandma the $54 that I saw that present was worth on Amazon, that would be an insult. 


**34:57** And I think we need to recognize that so much of culture runs on forms of flows that not only are hard to capture in tokens and other kinds of quantifiable economic values but actually cease to function when we do.  


**[35:13] Abbey:** I think that an interesting culture dichotomy within crypto is people who view money and financialization, I say money, really as a chaotic good versus a chaotic evil. And I think that this has always been the driving conversation in the free software movement as well, which is which side are you on? On one hand, everything that you just said, the financialization of everything just makes us financialize the social aspects of ourselves, which is incredibly harmful and is I think now has caused many problems in humanity and can be exemplified in many technological trends as well. But on the other hand, the ability to create culture, to create markets, to use these hyper-specific primitives to build outside of mainstream financialization is incredibly powerful in a very like wild magic type of way. 


**36:13** 	And I think that it's trying to grapple with the power and the potential of this technology to financialize everything and to incentivize everything, which can be incredibly freeing, versus the chaotic rollercoaster that it kind of puts you on. Like how do you remain resilient to the hyper financialization of the space? But in terms of culture, I mean, it's also incredibly, we were just talking about how culture pushes adoption. I think that sometimes financialization creates culture. And I think that a very large part of culture is financialized and so there's also a way to create culture. And maybe this is like a really hot philosophical take that a lot of people are gonna really be against, but financialization, I think can stimulate and create culture, which then drives new means of adoption.  


**37:09** And so I guess it's just figuring out how to wield that financialization. And there's a strong camp of people who disagree that's ever possible. And I think that there's a camp of people and a lot of them in the crypto space who potentially believe that we can wield these financial tools to kind of create new futures. And I think that I flip between the two camps, like, day to day, for real. 


**[37:32] Nathan:** Absolutely. And when you look at, like, classical free open source software, the things that they failed to do in the architecture of that movement and that culture was they totally punted on governance and economics. You are not allowed to talk about governance. You're not allowed to talk about economics. Those things are, they're taboo and they're still there, but they're hidden and they're weird. And it allows corporate capture and demands excess volunteer labor. It drives out people who have care work and don't have access to excess free time. And so absolutely, I mean, to put … and that's what I think. One of the things that is so exciting about what crypto promises is that it puts an economic and governance layer at the heart of open-source culture and open-source software.  


So the call here from my perspective is a balance. This is a tremendous opportunity to make things explicit that before have been hidden from view. But at the same time, we need to be aware, careful of the dangers. 


**[38:46] Eugene:** Yeah. I just remember hearing, the first time I heard from someone, the view of you know how you build decentralized communities, you rain money down on people. And the first time I heard that, I just got this visceral of just like, oh God, that sounds horrible. But in all fairness, also just being aware of the space, pretending that one is either good or evil while the other is the opposite is an overly reductionist view that isn't helpful. And to what both of you were saying, I mean if I'm correct in kind of sussing this out, it's the honest and transparent experimentation, knowing that we don't know the suite of incentives that will actually get us to the kind of culture that will keep us on track for our goal. And we have to kind of play around with that and be honest that there is a financial component and there are big non-financial components. And we don't know what that looks like and for different communities and goals, that balance might be different. But I guess to ask you both a question, instead of just trailing off, what would be the experimentation you want to see more of in that direction? Is it on honesty and openness? It is a specific type of experiment, sort of, do you see any particular things keeping us from just making more of the experimentation progress before we can propose more frameworks and ideas? 


**[39:56] Abbey:** I think one that immediately comes to mind is I guess, like research-driven work into what's working now. I really just think of the work that the other internet squad is doing, which is evaluating the governance of different systems and doing exactly also what Nathan did, which is evaluate what is governance for specific protocol communities? Because it's not just the governance smart contracts that make up the ecosystem. Where is governance happening? How is it happening? What is participation and understand the different aspects of governance and start presenting observations and conclusions around participation and the values and the culture of the space? And before we can start defining culture, I think it's trying to understand what aspects of these emergent networks actually impact culture. And right now it's a patchwork of tools that make up the social infrastructure behind these governing systems. 


**40:53** And it's evaluating those and using these in-depth analyses to drive conversations around what can be improved. Because if you have everything out in front of you, then you can say, well, this is interesting because this maybe doesn't align with this value of this project. Or if you don't know what the values of the project are, having everything in front of you allows you to kind of have those conversations with the community. So, I really do think that analyzing what governance is for different protocol communities is something that should be happening earlier than later. I know it's something that I've been trying to do within the Radicle, which is a very early emergent ecosystem and we're just activating governance. And my goal is for anything that's happening with governance to document it and put it in an open and accessible hub where it can be used to be tracked and engaged with, to support the growth of whatever is to come.  


**41:48** And I think that we should all be trying to look at governance and really truly trying to understand it in relation to our communities and the role that we wanna have in the future. And getting people to steward that culture within governing communities is also really important. So I think that's like first and foremost before diving into like experimentation, it's like truly understanding the authority services and the playing field within your communities and ecosystems. 


**[42:15] Nathan:** Yeah. And the experiments I think are most important, are how can you make sure that your economy is accountable to something, to the people who are affected by it? And this is that old, like kind of liberal dream of wrapping the economy in a democracy. But we can do that in a lot of different creative ways. And I'm really excited about the kind of exploration that's going on right now, all around us. Again, I work in like the cooperative business tradition, but it's here in crypto that people are coming up with new voting systems every week. And the froth of this world is just really exciting. But I would caution each project or invite each project. It shouldn't be a caution, to say, where are you holding your economy accountable to the real human needs at stake, the stuff that can't be captured in that economy? Because no economy is complete, no economy is able to see every externality.  


**43:25** And it shouldn't have to. In some cases that might mean embedding values at the center of what you're doing. So 1hive, which I talked about earlier, has this covenant at the center of what it does. If people violate, the natural language values expressed in that covenant there's a dispute resolution system that adjudicates those claims and holds people accountable to those through cryptoeconomic methods, to these non-economic values. Another way is to do it at the infrastructure level and to set rules at the level of infrastructure so that individual projects can just be simple and focused on their economic goals.  


**44:14** So for instance, you could consider an example like a project running on Ethereum that is just focused on this kind of financial transaction. But maybe at the level of Ethereum, there is some regulative mechanism that says, okay, if any app built on this system does this thing, we're going to notice it, detect it and not confirm those transactions. And we see an example of this kind of external regulative mechanism in, I think a very positive way, in which the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s expectation of sufficient decentralization has compelled projects that might not otherwise decentralize power and value to do so, as a way of avoiding having to file securities documents.  


**45:13** And those kinds of, big picture, value setting regulations, I think can be actually really valuable. And we need to start thinking as this space explodes, what kinds of values are written into the system? What kinds of values do we really need to start writing into the system? And of course, it doesn't have to be uniform. But I am concerned that the values written into these systems are still are values that treat us as solely economic beings. And I think that's a dangerous mistake and the stakes are getting higher every day. We really need to, and I think a lot of projects are, center that conversation more about in what ways are our economics being held accountable to something else. 


**[46:11] Eugene:** Yeah. And just disclosing some of my personal views. I mean, I feel like the economic side is kind of in some ways easier to default to because there's a clearer, more quote, unquote "rational why" behind things. Whereas if you just pull away all the specifics of your life and you're like, why am I actually doing any of the set of things that I'm currently involved in, that can open up a can of worms that most people prefer to not open up frequently?  


**Nathan:** Yeah. It's credible neutrality, right? 


**[46:36] Eugene:** Yeah, absolutely. And that's where, I think that's sort of, I always love trying to think of governance through an existential psychology lens. And what is the meaning of life identity? What do these questions inform here? Because I think these are questions we're not always able to be honest with ourselves about. The more we can suss that out on the individual level and then think of community and larger social structures, then we can kind of get a better sense of the interaction there. But I mean there are so many amazing topics that we, unfortunately, haven't gotten to delve deeper into, in terms of the role of very specific explicit versus implicit social contracts. And some of the nuances between those. I know we talked about the code of conduct, which is in that direction, but not exclusively that, digging in a little more on the education side, the global aspect was something else because I feel like a lot of crypto organizations don't always acknowledge.  


**47:25** 	Yeah, we're global, we're global, but that means you're gonna have people who have inherently different starting points of culture and what are you doing to create shared language and knowledge and understanding. And one thing that I really was hoping we would get to dig into, but unfortunately don’t have time, but the whole question of how do you create a loop of continuous process diffusion in a system? That's just such a fascinating question and both on the human personality level of who are the kind of people who are willing to create that and say, I wanna build this to never have power. And to enforce that consistently. I don't know is that individual differences, cultural differences, a mix of everything that leads to that, but it's been a lovely conversation and I just wanna give each one of you a chance to kind of wrap up with any thoughts or statements that are on your mind, given what we haven't gotten to yet, but there's never a shortage of what we could have dove into.  


**[48:17] Abbey:** Everything that you just said could be a whole other podcast. And I'd be very interested to dive into that as well. But I think that we're all entering this very interesting phase of governance as we start to see these protocol ecosystems start to mature and start to grapple with, not only the size of their treasuries but the size of their developer communities. And I think that these conversations, that Nathan's work, all are driving the conversation forth on how we can be designing social systems within technological, I mean, technical networks. And I think that that's an incredibly powerful space to be in. And it's something that we've been bordering for a long time. And I feel that now that DAOs are a thing and people are doing governance without even knowing that they're doing governance we'll see more of a focus on experimentation, with how we can be reevaluating and reconfiguring governance to support different means of culture in the long term.  

**49:24** 	And so I feel like there's a lot of really great people who are driving the conversation forth on this. And as someone who's now trying to implement these practices in real-time, I'm very interested in more round table forums to get involved with to kind of move that forward. So that's what I'll close with. And so if anybody's interested in kind of continuing the conversation or has things that they'd like to share you can reach out on Twitter. My Twitter's Abbey_titcomb. 

**Eugene:** And I'll make sure to include socials and any links in this show notes for the episode.
 
[**50:02] Nathan:** Yeah. Lots of great conversations around your Twitter account. I always love checking out what's on the mind of you and all the people with whom you're arguing with. And yeah, I mean this conversation makes me realize what I keep doing over and over in this space, is, like, asking people to hold contradictions. So some of my earlier workaround decentralization, was like, yes, decentralization, but here's this weird thing, in order to get decentralization, you might need to intentionally centralize some things. And that's okay. And it would be better if you did that intentionally than if it shows up. And in these current questions of governance, the ask is, okay, cryptoeconomics is doing some really, really cool things, and let's embrace that, let's celebrate the creativity around here. 

**50:58** But we also need to explore the space that is able to counteract the very thing that is producing so much enthusiasm. In order to have systems that are accountable to us, we have to make sure that our systems don't get ahead of themselves, that they don't become so powerful that we put so much trust in one thing that we lose our ability to put it in check when it needs to be. And that ability to hold contradictions, I mean, some say it's a sign of a kind of mature mind, the ability to recognize that two things can be true at once that may seem to contradict each other. And I think similarly, the maturing of the crypto ecosystem is gonna require that kind of holding of contradictions, recognizing that we need to jump into and embrace these exciting new possibilities, while at the same time, being able to kind of double down on their opposites.

**[52:10] Abbey:** And also hold those contradictions to stay true to the values that we want to present. Because I think that there'll be a lot of externalities facing, like specifically the web3 space that will challenge a lot of the values that we're attempting to embed into our technology, and the best way to challenge and to combat that is to hold contradictions. So I love that phrase so much, totally using that from now on, for real. 

**[52:37] Eugene:** Is the crypto version of that phrase HODL contradictions, or how does that? Anyway sorry sorry, this was a bad joke. After such a good conversation, I took us there. My apologies, but anyway, this was an awesome conversation. Thank you both for being part of it. And yeah, we'll make sure to include all of your links Nathan, and we'll include the link to your lab and meta.gov, and if y'all have any other relevant stuff, feel free to share, and we'll make sure to share with our audience. We'll have a post on this, on our forum to continue the conversation. And yeah, just really appreciate taking the time to be part of this and sharing your knowledge with others so that we can hopefully build this infrastructure of sharing. And I know there, to the extra meta, there are our research DAO, focused on DAO research now and like little things coming up. So it's really exciting to be part of this time. So, yeah. Thank you both.
