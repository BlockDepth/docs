**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[0:07]** Hello, and welcome to today's episode of the SCRF interviews, video podcast. I'm excited for the conversation that we're having exploring the intersection of culture and compensation with our guest professor, Ellie Rennie from RMIT and Zach Anderson from Coordinape. And so before we get into the actual conversation, I'll pass it off to each of the guests to introduce themselves. So Ellie, do you mind just quickly giving an introduction?

**Ellie Rennie:**

**[0:34]** Sure, so I'm a professor at RMIT University in the blockchain innovation hub. I do a type of research called digital ethnography, which means trying to get inside online communities to understand how they work and together with some other folk at Govbase, which some of you may have heard of. We've been designing tools that enable us to work with participants inside discord servers, to try to understand blockchain governance, but also some of these issues around work and compensation better. And the community that we've been piloting these methods with happens to be SourceCred, which is one of the first and probably most elaborate systems there is for trying to compensate people using an algorithm. And that codebase is used within a number of different blockchain communities.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[1:27]** Great. Thank you, Ellie. Zach, do you mind jumping into the quick intro? \

**Zach Anderson:**

**[1:33]** Sure. I am indeed. Zach. I am a core contributor at Coordinape also a contributor at Yearn [Finance] and of course, like any good web person, like ten other DAOs that I'm very excited about and distract myself with. So, but, primarily my focus is on Coordinape, and Coordinape is a platform for DAOs to allocate resources to contributors around that are doing various work that adds value. So Coordinape is a system where we're decentralizing decisions around compensation so that people pay each other based on their perceived value that others are adding.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[2:19]** Great! Thank you both for providing that background. And, to jump into the conversation, and sort of building on what both of you were alluding to in terms of your experience in, in affiliations, I just wonder what you see as interesting or sort of sitting at this intersection of culture and compensation and what you see as the related matters when you think of that area.

**Ellie Rennie:**

**[2:43]** I'm happy to go first on that one and I'll quote something that I heard within a SourceCred meeting, in fact, where someone pointed out that once you leave your workplace at a regular organization, you may have built up all these friendships, but you leave and then they just become LinkedIn connections. And for me, that really resonated as the difference that we're seeing in these decentralized organizations and the kinds of work that occurs there as being maybe, maybe work-like and similar, but also has all these other cultural dynamics. And also people are not there on some kind of payroll necessarily, or with I suppose, many of the typical workplace codes in place. So how do we ensure that the work that's being done, which is often otherwise voluntary, gets rewarded, but also how do you break some of those formalities and, oh, wow, I suppose just strict boundaries that current workplaces impose and make them more about the community and the collaboration that occurs? But I'm going to hand it over to Zach because I'm particularly curious to hear more about Coordinape’s exact model and how you came up with it.

**Zach Anderson:**

**[4:19]** Well, sure. I mean, I can start there because it sort of leads to this question about compensation and culture. Coordinape has its roots in lots of different things and ideas, both Tracheopteryx and Zemm. Our co-founders with me brought a lot of their experience, a lot of what we learned at Yearn. And, and one of the other things is, it was rooted in my old company that I co-founded with some friends called Converge. And Converge is a consultancy helping basically environmental and social impact networks. So people collaborate around systemic issues and at Converge, we were sort of like a prototypical IRL DAO without knowing it, our focus is on networks. So that was the language we used, but Converge has never had any employees or payroll. 

**Zach Anderson:**

**[5:11]** And the process we used for paying each other was - we affectionately kind of called “Thunderdome” as a joke, thinking it was going to be like everyone trying to get the most for themselves. It turned out to be much the opposite, actually that people were, if anything, trying to reward their friends and peers more, but we would do a project and say we invoiced some amount of money and we would put it in the middle of the proverbial or actual literal table and say like, okay, there's $35,000 here for X months of work. Like how much did you get, what do you think you earned? How much do you think I should get? 

**Zach Anderson:**

**[5:54]** And it would be a conversation until everybody, like… the conversation is over when everyone says, “like, okay, I feel good about this”; and that's how we have run Converge for the past eight years. Coordinape is essentially that same process, but trying to take it into the decentralized asynchronous space of DAOs and saying instead of one person or some small group of people using their subjective ideas and standards about who should be paid what, let's ask the community itself, push the decision, making to the edges and ask people where they've seen value be created. And I think this is a really important cultural element of Web3 because it really, one: it creates a different mindset around gratitude and generosity; the fact that you're literally thanking people. 

**Zach Anderson:**

**[6:47]** The token in Coordinape is called $GIVE, and you're giving people things and sending them notes and saying, “hey, here's what you did. And here's why I appreciate it” and that's turns into money that's a lot different than getting a paycheck. The other reason it's different is that it really pushes more sovereignty onto… onto people, and instead of in a traditional organization where I'm, essentially, it's just me versus the company, right? And my job is sort of to see how much I can get in compensation from this company. In a DAO, we're all owners of it, right? So I'm the steward of the collective resources as well as for myself. And so it, it structurally creates more of a, self-interest shared-interest dynamic than a lot of companies who, for the most part, especially these larger organizations, are kind of going to go on whether you're involved or not. And so those are, those are two ways that culture changes.

**Ellie Rennie: **

**[7:48]** I'm really interested to hear how that plays out in terms of, because it's a giving model, does it become a popularity contest or are people more inclined to reward everyone or does everyone in the end feel that there's a fair balance that results from that method?

**Zach Anderson:**

**[8:14]** I would say all of the above, there's over 400 circles running now on Coordinape. So we definitely see all those kinds of use cases. I think this goes back to again, like when I think is the most important cultural piece of Coordinape and what the potential that it does allow. We always say that in Coordinape the results of each distribution are transparent and clear. So you can see there's a graph that shows each person and not exactly how much, but you can see who gave to who and who received from who. And we always say that the conversations that can come out of the allocation are much more valuable than the allocation itself. And one of the things that we've learned and this has been true for, for decades in management science, like what are the characteristics of high performing teams?

**Zach Anderson:**

**[9:08]** It's psychological safety and equal contribution and so how do we use these sort of dynamics to create that kind of psychological safety? So there will certainly be people who give a little bit to everyone in the circle, hoping they'll create some sort of like, “Oh, well, they gave to me. So I guess I should give to them, right?” They'll be either conscious or a lot of times subconscious gaming of things. There will be someone who posts to Discord all the time about the things they're doing, and people may have the perception that they're contributing a lot while someone else is not on Discord at all, because they're busy writing code, they're actually doing so much more. But the hope is that over time those dynamics are going to be present anyway, and this can help surface them. And now we're actually having a conversation about, well, what do we actually think is valuable? 

**Zach Anderson:**

**[10:04]** This person got the most give for what exactly? And someone can put their hands up and be like, look, I shipped ten GitHub repos last week and I only got this much. So those kinds of things will happen and they can make the team stronger because they're seeing these dynamics play out. And I can also say that we have many many examples of teams saying this is about the same distribution that we thought it would be, or this seems right. And the difference is that everyone is way more satisfied with the outcome because they all participated in it. They all understand how it came to be, their voice is heard and so a lot of distributions would land about where people think, but their satisfaction is higher than if it came down from some committee who has kind of a black box process of like, how did you decide who gets what. 

**Elllie Rennie:**

**[11:06]** So one of the theories that I've picked up picked up on within SourceCred is similar to that, which, and it was, I think it was expressed in a video of the founder Dandelion [Mané] talking at a Web3 summit where they say that the security of SourceCred comes through community and through community moderation. So even though their algorithm is derived from Google's page rank algorithm and Google creates security through obscurity, in SourceCred it's through visibility and through attention. And that's what I find most fascinating about these DAO tools that are being used now, both these two examples, in particular, is its showing how decentralization can create, I suppose you could call it security or some kind of just robustness or resilience or something like that through the dynamics of the group. And in fact, what these tools possibly, and this is just a theory for me, only work in stronger communities. What do you think about that?

**Zach Anderson:**

**[12:24]** I don't know. I think they definitely work. We know they work well in higher trust communities in situations. Almost everything works better in higher trust communities. Trust is actually like the most important ingredient for a successful collaboration that's well, well-documented. And so, I think though that actually, we've seen at least in some preliminary… Bankless has run circles with more than 200 people run Coordinape circles. And I think what it lacks - obviously, there are very few people that… almost no one knows what everybody's been doing. But as long as it has fundamentally, anyway, whether it's a four-person committee distributing resources or whether it's the whole community there's still going to be some allocation. 

**Zach Anderson:**

**[13:23]** And I think that having an active part in that definitely makes people more trusting of the outcomes. It definitely makes people more engaged and thinking through and understanding things instead of just like writing a grant and if they get it great, but like why? How does this decision-making happen? And that's hard to document. So yeah, I think there’s certainly Dunbar’s effects. And I think we're still learning and it’s still very early, like what is the optimal circle size? What teams should be... are most informed to make decisions about the value being added by others? I think probably the bigger group you get will find is like the quality of sort of the insight that people have maybe goes down in larger circles. For example, we see a lot, like you can sort of group out how teams are essentially all giving to each other. So we'll see how that goes too. And ideally, hopefully using like SourceCred and Coordinape increase the trust in these larger, more diffuse, groups.

**Ellie Rennie:**

**[14:44]** So how, within your system, are past contributions rewarded? Can that happen or is it all based upon a particular epoch or timeframe that's set?

**Zach Anderson:**

**[14:57]** Its users define the epoch that they want to allocate over. So,we definitely have had groups that said, “okay, we've been doing this project we've been working in this DAO for X amount of months and sort of do one Coordinape epoch for contributions up to this point, right.” So sort of like a comprehensive, like, “if I think back over the last X amount of time and think about all the things you've done to get us here” and then allocate that way and then sort of get into more of a cadence. A lot of people use bi-weekly or monthly cadences to do their allocations, but it's definitely been used that way to do sort of retroactive.

**Ellie Rennie:**

**[15:43]** Yeah. I find the retroactive thing particularly interesting because, I mean, particularly with the SourceCred algorithm, if someone's created a core piece of code, that's still being used or even something that was created a long time ago, but didn't get picked up and gets picked up two years down the track. And then suddenly it's being used a lot and that person is earning credit for that, or being recognized is another way of putting it. And they've long since left that community. It's an interesting dynamic, certainly not something you would see in a regular work context. I think academics kind of do it through citations where it would be impossible. 

**Ellie Rennie:**

**[16:29]** I mean, our universities were always trying to rate us on an annual basis, but of course, you might come up with a discovery that doesn't– that's not important until after you've retired. So should we therefore not do those important fundamental discoveries and just go for the thing that's going to get recognized now? So I think academics experience the hardship of this in a different way. But yeah, so I think for me, I've been fascinated by some of those dynamics around past contributions and I suppose how people feel about that because there's something very temporal about online communities. 

**Ellie Rennie:**

**[17:11]** If I look at, and I can see because of SourceCred’s system, the algorithm, how long people have been involved, and many of the current people that are maintaining this codebase are reasonably new. They're not the original people necessarily. And in fact, the founder very consciously stepped out recently and did that kind of handover, like I'm officially gone now type of thing. So there's… and that to me is a good thing that you can have renewal in these communities. But where does the organizational memory go in these places? Perhaps some of these tools are also a way of retaining some of that organizational memory too?

**Zach Anderson:**

**[18:01]** I mean, it is interesting that it relies on the memory of whoever happens to be there. I think, a lot of us, this reminds me of the like, we're all standing on the shoulders of giants. A lot of times especially the ones that we don't know about and so yeah, it's a really intriguing idea of how can you actually get credit due to the people who are actually making the contribution? I think especially when you talk about that, to me, it brings up like an equity lens, right? And how can we, how can we make sure that everyone is actually being evaluated and allocated based on their actual contribution and not there's a history obviously of men getting all of the credit and reward for ideas that were not theirs. There's a lot of that and so that's a hope of Web3 is how we think about these systems for decentralized rewarding are also a way to maybe start to, to dismantle some of these larger patterns, of various forms of oppression and patriarchy and whatnot.

**Ellie Rennie:**

**[19:30]**Yeah, which does also raise the extent to which these tools may become useful in governance in terms of showing what's been done and what is valued that I suppose our human biases can not easily compute all the time? I'm thinking, for instance, of some of the delegation governance systems we've seen lately, where people who are really good at Twitter seem to end up as delegates, which, having been on boards, is not necessarily how I would do it. There would be a skills matrix and diversity criteria and all of these other things. And I'm not saying that these kinds of tools that we're talking about today will necessarily resolve that issue. But at least we have now some kind of record of what's been valued and who has done what, which can start those conversations.

**Zach Anderson:**

**[20:42]** Yeah, I think the conversation itself is just what's important. I mean, we're operating in at least a frame of transparency and if not perfect, transparency, certainly like a radical leap in transparency from what most people have experienced in pyramid- shaped organizations, right? Where most of the decisions that are happening, you have no idea really who's making them or really why they're being made or the rationale behind them. It's very hard to get into these limited roles and rooms and whatnot. And it's a fundamentally different paradigm when we're asking everybody who deserves credit for this, who should get paid, who’s adding value. 

**Zach Anderson:**

**[21:33]** It's sort of a massive shift and it's certainly not perfect. I think, and I'll speak for myself, I can get a little giddily naive about the future that the potential of DAOs, it shows us what’s possible, and the kinds of collaboration at scale, to actually be able to address some of these global crisis level problems that we're facing. And it is encouraging that there is like a fundamentally different paradigm going on and moving from sort of a pyramid structure to a spherical one as sort of our organizing criteria for how the communities work? Just the fact that DAOs are owned ostensibly by the people that are adding value to them is totally radical and moves this sort of co-op kind of the niche co-op world into like the primary organizing structure and that is hugely exciting. And I also agree that being good at Twitter is like one of the most asymmetric skillset, apparently being good at Twitter, especially crypto Twitter seems to have all sorts of benefits.

**Eugene Leventhal:** 

**[22:55]** I just wanted to quickly jump in with a question of, when kind of alluding to that aspect of as you were just kind of mentioning, shifting from the pyramid to more of this sphere and making that kind of transition and thinking about decentralization, how it affects culture, how it affects compensation, in terms of just the way both of you individually consider the landscape of problems right now, how much are they interpersonal problems that just, we're using better tools to surface what the problems are,

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[23:23]** and then it's a whole separate set of questions, how we deal with the interpersonal aspects of how do we just human better together, or how much of it is still sort of on the side of what are the mechanisms around being able to perform this? Is it a question of, well, how frequently do I get paid? Does that need to be standardized across circles to be bi-weekly so that is it kind of the actual delivery of how people interact with these systems and the specific aspects of thinking through those details that can replicate job security and comfort and provide people that comfortable work environment so that they do feel like they can do the best work and commit to building that trust because that takes time in an environment as well. 

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[24:04]** And I know there have been some communities where we had a separate discussion about onboarding, right? The whole question of how do you think about culture through the prism of onboarding and when do you start building that? Because it just takes time to build that trust. So yeah, long winded question to say, do you see more of the interpersonal or more of the actual mechanisms or forms of how you interact with people as kind of the, the areas you just find yourself more concerned about these days and think about more?

**Zach Anderson:** 

**[24:28]** The interpersonal is everything, like it doesn't at the end of every tool is a person and they say it like what is that? No plan survives contact with the enemy. Like, no system survives contact with the actual people that are going to use it, right? People are messy, irrational, emotional social beings. 

**Zach Anderson:**

**[24:51]** And so, I mean, I think this is particularly relevant because we hear this all the time. People have feature ideas for Coordinape or saying like we want to turn off the transparency of the map because people are giving to people because they feel bad. They didn't get enough give, not because they actually did anything useful. And it's like, well, that's not a tool function, right? That's a conversation. And I would say like at least 50% of the feature requests that we get are people saying there should be a feature that I don't have to have this hard conversation with the people I'm working with. And so I think that that is certainly as we move more remote and asynchronous, like the interpersonal stuff is going to be increasingly critical and there'll be an array of amazing tools. And there'll still be people at the end of them trying to figure out how to get along and collaborate.

**Ellie Rennie:** 

**[25:51]** Like Zach, and I think many other people working in this area, I have a history in community organizations spent many years in the community radio sector here in Australia and went to a school, which was a bit commune-like and I think those of us who have had those experiences very familiar with when communities become insular and breakdown and when you haven't experienced that you can easily idealized communities. And there's been a lot of great feminist writing in fact on the problems of community and the politics of difference and all of those types of things which I think are very relevant to their experiences of DAOs and web3 in general. But what we have and what we're doing differently is trying to find some level of automation that can, it will never ever rule out interpersonal dynamics, but it might diffuse them or background some processes. 

**Ellie Rennie:** 

**[25:51]** And sometimes that's going to not work very well. I mean, one example I suppose, is auto moderator in Reddit, which infamously hides your posts; but if you're a new person for a month, to make sure that you're not spamming or a bot or something like that, and so then you get a whole lot of people who are new to Reddit saying “why isn't anyone responding?” Because they can't even see that they've been made invisible. And I'm sure that there's going to be all of those kinds of problems arising through these new tools as well. But the fact is we live in an intermediated digital world, particularly in the case of DAOs where the experiences and challenges and ways of communicating that we have are online and have vulnerabilities because of that as well. So things like civil attacks or whatever it might be you get new problems in these places which do require responses and tools to deal with them. 

**Ellie Rennie:** 

**[28:26]** That's where we're at and it's about how we live with these bots and tools and how we make them suitable for the kinds of challenges that we face. And that to me is the fascinating point that we're at right now in web3. And over the last six months in particular where conversations around that are starting to happen in a very serious way. And it's moving out of say, everyone should just have a universal, basic income; and in some respects, I think perhaps what you've just described there, Zach, where people are giving to someone because it looked like they didn't have enough is perhaps part of that human desire to make sure that everyone has something and that's good and you're right. I don't think we should be stopping that dynamic. And like we see in SourceCred that there are people who will say, no, I'm not going to claim my grain this time around because I don't need it and I'd prefer it to go to the treasury so that other people get a better payout. So you do start to see a kind of care for the community and for each other, which is a really valuable thing in my opinion.

**Zach Anderson:**

**[29:38]** Yeah, there's definitely it's interesting actually, several groups, including ourselves at Coordinape, have now created, we have our own sort of internal UBI; so everyone that's a core contributor gets X amount of set, set compensation every month. And then sort of, take market rate compensation and whatever is above that UBI, we put into a big pool to be distributed via the Coordinape mechanism, via community allocation. So the idea that everyone has a baseline can help reduce some of that. Like, well, man, I don't want to leave them with anything, I also don't want to slowly create a free rider culture where somebody who's not contributing that much still gets an allocation because people feel bad for them because that's not what we're trying to create. 

**Zach Anderson:**

**[30:34]** And really, the ultimate expression of a DAO is a full harnessing of collective intelligence and the DAO sort of itself as conjured by its members has some, some will that it's trying to carry out. And so the purpose of the culture is to support the DAO in its purpose and a purpose isn't supported by people that aren't helping [by] taking resources. And so there's sort of this, like there's always these trade-offs in their dynamic tensions, it's not a problem, well, what are you going to do: reward free riders or be cutthroat and just like, no it's value only. It's like, well, it's always going to be some mix and navigation of that and how you set that culture. But we have, and other groups have sort of created internal UBI’s as part of Coordinape to reduce some of that sort of friction.

**Ellie Rennie:** 

**[31:33]** I'm curious as to how you take leave. If you want to go on holiday or you are not well, or you've got some family issues going on, is there just a standard procedure for that? Or you, you tell each other, or how does it work? Cause I find that taking time out and still having some kind of salary is an important thing too.

**Zach Anderson:** 

**[31:59]** Yeah, I mean, it's yeah, people can leave whenever they want to do whatever they want. Obviously we're, we're trying to attract community members who are aware of balancing their self and shared interests; so they understand that if there's a key contributor in some project flow and they're not just, “Hey, I'm leaving for a week”. There's some way to make sure that work continues to flow and gets things done. I think it's kind of basic communication skills and right now it's still small enough. Our core group to where we can just say, I'm going to be gone Wednesday. I'm going to be out Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, I'll get back to this stuff whenever. As a community gets bigger, there's obviously different ways that you can go about doing that. But I think that it's also, you could look at it one way and say, well, if you don't, if you're not working, then you're not getting paid. This is a problem. 

**Zach Anderson:** 

**[33:05]** You could also look at it as a totally liberating thing. And if I say, you know what, I'm taking two weeks off and I don't have to worry that I'm burdening, somehow, the community, or am I really earning my pay now I can't take any more time off ever because I've already taken my two weeks. It's like, no, if you don't contribute anything, you won't get paid anything. It's fine. It allows a lot more freedom to come and go. And if somebody says: “I just got this opportunity to do this awesome project over here”, like I'm going to tie up these loose ends and I'm gone for a month. It's like, oh, okay. Like, that's a bummer, like I look forward to having you coming back, but also awesome for you. 

**Zach Anderson:** 

**[33:49]** Like, go ahead and do it. There are no negotiations around how long your leave is and what are we going to do with this much pay and what about your benefit? It's like, no, everything is very, it becomes very, very fluid. It Coordinape just to sort of build on that point. In this paradigm, this sort of the end of hiring and firing you no longer have to go through this process of here's what I'm going to do. Well, are you going to do this? Okay. We make and then lock both ourselves into this imagined future, as opposed to, why don't you just come start working and we'll start paying you and then we'll see how it goes. It makes a tremendous amount more sense.

**Ellie Rennie:** 

**[34:36]** I love the idea that we don't have to apply for jobs in the same way anymore. We join a community and see how it goes, and whether it's a good fit or not becomes apparent through just normal forces. When that happens and someone joins and then it's not a good fit, do they just disappear? Is that generally what happens? Or they just don't get that involved.

**Zach Anderson:** 

**[35:07]** It tends to be that someone, and I've only had this experience to be honest, like once so far in this whole endeavor, but I'm sure there's lots of anecdotal stories out there, but someone comes with a lot of enthusiasm and ideas on what's going to add value to the community and they start doing it. Right? And then when the community allocates, they don't get nearly as big as allocation as they thought. And they're essentially saying: ”look like I wrote, look at all this stuff I wrote and look at all this stuff I published, and that I did”; and it's like, yeah, but we’re rewarding value, not product it's like no one in the community thought that this writing was adding that much value. 

**Zach Anderson:** 

**[35:51]** And they were sort of like; they had a different opinion about what the value was; and so, they bounced out. Some people might come in and do the same thing, make a bunch of stuff and say, this is so cool, look, I'm going to help; and then people like, ah, like, you know what would've been cooler? It's like, if you did this and then they stick around and do it and like, great. Now you've got a feedback loop going for them of what's valuable and for the community, of what's valuable. It's also, I think it creates a lot more possibilities, if I go up to the CEO of my company, I say, I have this crazy, outrageous idea that I want to do. And I don't know if it'll work. It's like, no, and you're not approved and you can't get the budget. And this isn't. Whereas if someone in a DAO has a crazy idea that they want to try, they can just rock up and do it. And, you know, if, if someone says like, I want to try this, it's like, no, that's terrible. It'll never work versus I did this. It's just an entirely different conversation and that you can say like, wow, you're compensated for that.

**Zach Anderson:** 

**[37:04]** I think it just, it rewards a certain kind of entrepreneurial or risk taking person that can actually, you know that becomes like discerning what's valuable in a community and then producing it is, I think, an incredible skill to start honing for the 21st Century. And so hopefully tools, like Source Good and Coordinape, help facilitate that. I don't need to wait for permission from anybody to start adding what I think is valuable and then I get that immediate feedback loop from the community and what is valuable.

**Ellie Rennie:** 

**[37:43]** Do you think that some kinds of work get rewarded over others unfairly?

**Zach Anderson:** 

**[37:50]** I don't know. I think the only real answer to that is that each community kind of has to determine that, I mean it's really hard, so context-dependent, right? I mean, whoever made the 3, 3 meme for OHM added, arguably as much value as ten coders who actually built the thing. Right? And you could make the exact same argument vice versa. So we actually made the whole thing; all you did is made this little meme; which one was more valuable? And that's what I think is beautiful. It's up for the community to sort of really figure this out. And there's other, kind of customizations, and things that people have done to give certain people, for example, larger allocations of GIVE. So if someone is kind of running the tech team and there's a lot of engineers that are working more solo, or just like kind of running on a project hard that don't have as much exposure and people don't understand, all these inner workings, it's probably more important that they get a disproportionate amount of award. 

**Zach Anderson:**

**[39:01]** There's different ways to sort of think of it that way. It doesn't always have to be even. We're very into hierarchies. I am super supportive of hierarchies which I think gets a bad rap in web3. But I think a lot of, and this is actually something I'm excited about is a lot of the skills, like community curation: weaving, onboarding, checking in, culture creation; a lot of these things it's very hard. Even when I coordinate, when we're talking about what did you do this week? Well, I ship three PRs, what did you do? Oh, well, I was on a SCRF interview podcast. Okay, like how much value does that have? It depends, right? It's really subjective for people to try and understand. So yes, different work gets rewarded in all sorts of different ways and it depends on sort of the culture and also on the conversations we're having again about what is valuable

**Ellie Rennie:**

**[40:09]** I think Eugene and I are now feeling the pressure to make this a good podcast so that you get some reward for it.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[40:15]** It's a whole new dimension to socializing.

**Ellie Rennie:** 

**[40:21]** Yeah, I mean one of the reasons I ask is, early on when I first started getting interested in blockchains and that’s going back to gosh, 2016, 2017, I started looking at D-cred it was one of the early communities that was, doing something like a DAO and had a treasury where you could apply to do something like marketing and people would have to vote on whether to fund that activity. Richard Reed has written a lot about this, so he actually has kind of picked up documenting that journey for Source Cred and done, sorry for D-cred all these creds and done a really good job of it. 

**Ellie Rennie:** 

**[41:03]** But I mean, I suppose what I'm trying to get at here it's a very different method to where the treasury voting model where you apply to do something and you have a ton of developers involved in that thing who think that coding is the most important thing in the world. Whereas someone who makes memes as you point out might not be able to get rewarded or even get commissioned in this case. Whereas if it's more that I'm rewarding, you retrospectively for what you've done, you can see that the 3, 3 meme has worked in that particular example. And even maybe some of those developers would be inclined to throw some rewards in that direction. So it possibly, I don’t know, I don’t have any evidence of this, but it would seem to me that maybe you get more diversity of outcomes as a result, what do you think?

**Zach Anderson:** 

**[42:11]** Yeah, I certainly, this is one of the reasons we're a huge advocate for, kind of the original use case of Coordinape was, community circles. And it was at Yearn, where you have all sorts of community contributors coming and doing things. And there was a small committee that was in charge of grants, and they would get 20 grant applications  in a month. And someone was saying: “I want $3,000 because I translated everything into Russian”; and another person was saying, “I want $4,000 because I'm moderating Discord”; and there's another person who they know is doing tons of stuff who didn't even ask for a grant and like, how do you make these apples to oranges comparisons? And also like, why are we the ones deciding this? Like whoever voted us to be the grant committee? 

**Zach Anderson:** 

**[42:03]** This just sort of happened, right? So that was really the tension that Coordinape was designed around: let's just push the decision-making out and let the community decide how we should allocate this grant money. As we've done the same thing at Coordinape, somebody, Lloyd Banksy showed up in our discord and started making all these memes and it's like, oh, these are great. If someone had said: “I propose I want you to allocate this much money and I will make this many memes”; it's like I don't know. I'm not going to vote for that. I want to see the memes first; as opposed to he made them. And then you're like, oh, this is great. He's in the community circle now. And we have a  budget, sort of allocated, for the community circle every month so that you… it's essentially like an R and D from the community, like, come try this stuff, do stuff, help out. There's a reward there. If you consistently keep adding value in this sort of bigger community circle layer, what's going to happen eventually? 

**Zach Anderson:** 

**[44:10]** We're going to say like, why don't you come do a lot more of this? And so, yeah, I think it creates a much bigger diversity and a much faster feedback loop and turnaround time, as concerning what's valuable. And it also increases innovation because my preconceived idea about what's valuable is obviously going to have tons of blind spots that someone needs a chance to come expose and then finally it creates a doer. This is really important, the sort of doer mentality so that instead of like, we'll pay me to do something and then I'll make it as opposed to someone that's saying, Hey, I'm excited about this stuff. I've got some ideas, like, check it out. I did it. What do you think? Like, that is so crucial for DAOs. Every DAO has lots of people showing up the Discord saying, what do I do? How can I help? Where do I get involved? And every DAO has a few people who also show up and be like, I'm excited about this. I have some skills to offer here. Here's what I'm going to start doing.

**Ellie Rennie:**

**[45:19]** It's interesting. I came across an advert; I think it was Rye DAO manager, recently, a job advert. And my goodness, that was a humongous role. They were going to pay a hundred grand a year or something like it. They were definitely going to reward it well. But it was kind of confronting almost; to see it spelled out in a regular job advert; what work goes on in a DAO. So, and if you can distribute that work, that's a different situation and really what you're talking about, but I did wonder how on earth are they going to fill that position. 

**Zach Anderson:** 

**[46:06]** Well, it's interesting and this draws on the converge work because we have these networks running for various stewarding 500,000 acres of redwoods, or defending migrant rights across borders across central America and Mexico. And these are groups of 60 and 70 people, that all are working sort of in one part of this much larger effort. And the network coordinator role is hypercritical. And there are lots of different metaphors we use to describe it. I like sort of an air traffic control, I think is very apt, right? You're not actually doing the work, but you are helping the work to get done and creating that cohesion and culture.

**Zach Anderson:** 

**[46:50]** I think, gardener, symphony conductor, there's a lot of different metaphors for what that role is doing. But, it's fundamentally about information coming in and curating that and then sending the information back out, but especially also facilitating that information across. And that's really the secret sauce of DAOs, it's not kind of the core people hosting a town hall and telling you what's going on and hearing from the community, it's them being able to say, oh, Ellie, you're into that? You should talk to Eugene, because he's been working on this other thing it's that sort of linking and weaving the community together which is hypercritical and is in some ways like the toughest thing to train there's some people who are just mensch who are, are into that and track that, and I think it’s going to be an increasingly, increasingly, hyper, hyper important role in these DAOs as they proliferate.

**Eugene Leventhal:** 

**[47:52]** I just wanted to jump in and ask, especially as we're getting close to time, and recognizing that we unfortunately have to wrap up shortly, I kind of want to think about the element, because we've already talked a little bit about how there's the interpersonal change that's at the back of any tool, right? It's not just specific to crypto, web3, DAOs, et cetera, but there's also this element of, for folks who are now designing tools, they have to be aware of as people start using it, there's that feedback loop that's developed that can hopefully enforce and reinforce culture over time. 

**Eugene Leventhal:** 

**[48:27]** So I guess, from your perspective, what do you see as sort of, if you had to start building a new system tomorrow, right, whether it's a new protocol, reward system, whatever, like you were just tasked with having to build a new community from scratch, what would be the kind of things you're thinking about and keeping top of mind, recognizing the power of that loop? Because I don't think that's something that's, at least I know in speaking to folks who I know, in CS or engineering, that loop isn't always reinforced as a top priority, as you're thinking about how your design requirements meet human beings, meet something beyond that. And so, yeah, I was just wondering and kind of, yeah, using this as a segue towards the end here just in general, how powerful you see that loop is, and the way to think about some aspects around it?

**Ellie Rennie:**

**[49:15]** I'll say something which is pretty basic. And I'm sure Zach has a more sophisticated answer, but for me, purely from an ethnographic point of view, as someone observing what goes on, channels or systems for gratitude and attention and appreciation are really important if you want to make these systems work. And also I would say these are the things that will be transformative in the long run, because they change how we behave towards each other and they enhance specific values and ways of working and being in the world. So if that's an algorithm, that's causing us to do that, I'm fine with it. If we all just in the end be better to each other.

**Zach Anderson:** 

**[50:18]** I have to say like that is the… if I was going to start building another tool, it would look a lot like Coordinape, for the reason Ellie just said. I think at the very base of Maslow's pyramid is some version of seeing and being seen; like people's actual biggest need is they want to give their gifts or give their talents and help, and add value and then be seen and rewarded and acknowledged for it and be appreciated. This is sort of the core human need. And so, creating systems that facilitate that, that are diverse enough to where all of the people's different gifts and points of view and ways of being, have a welcome place somewhere, right?

**Zach Anderson:**

**[51:10]** That they can sort of have found their way into something and find a way to contribute to that thing that's bigger than themselves and then be seen and rewarded and thanked for it and compensation obviously is a huge part of that. But not just compensation and, if we had more time, we could get all into extrinsic and intrinsic motivation and how there are certain kinds of problems that offering more money makes you worse at solving, not better. And they're most of the important ones, the creative ones. And so yeah I think, as we think about these tools, start from, from really think about like what are ways of being and cultures that we really want to support and let flourish. It's been fascinating to me, in this web3 world which I came to about a year ago with no computer science experience and I've never written any code,

**Zach Anderson:**

**[52:14]** and seeing, this industry that has such deep roots, in deep code in engineering and crypto and crypto’s whole sort of worldview is like safety against attack vector, right? It needs to be totally permissionless and trustless and sort of completely adversarial. And now this layer that's being built on top of it is a much different mindset. It's much more humanistic and it's like, actually, we don't need to make all of these failsafes and protections in DAOs because DAOs are largely collaborative trustful environments. One of the questions we get all the time on Coordinape is, well, how do you prevent collusion? People could just talk to each other and decide to give their gift to each other. There's actually very little material reward for doing that. 

**Zach Anderson:**

**[53:13]** It's not that advantageous and it'll be quickly found out and you'll kind of burn all your social cred for like a few extra bucks one month, but we haven't seen it happen almost at all, right? Like people are not consciously gaming things like this. Most people are part of a DAO because they want to contribute and they want to be acknowledged for it. So I think, this next layer, it's going to be really fascinating to see the space evolve as it sort of grows out of its hardcore engineering roots and hopefully includes that obviously as it transcends into more including humanistic tendencies and humanistic perspectives as well.

**Eugene Leventhal:** 

**[53:59]** Great. Thank you so much. That's such a wonderfully hopeful and positive note to end on. I definitely hope that is the future, that is in store for us and appreciate both the research and work both of you are doing to at least try to contribute and nudge us in that direction as much as possible. So, yeah thank you both for taking the time to chat with us today. And yeah, we look forward to our future conversations.
