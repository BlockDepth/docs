**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[0:07]** Hello and welcome to today's episode of SCRF Interviews. In a bit of a non-traditional one, we're changing our structure from just highlighting what research is taking place, bringing together industry practitioners and academics to taking some time to actually discuss what SCRF is all about. And we figured what better way to do that than me having a conversation with our co-founder and leader Richard Brown.

So I guess just to get us kicked off Rich, do you want to do a quick little intro before we start chatting SCRF?

**Richard Brown:**

**[0:37]** Sure. I would be happy to.

 I always stumble on these things because I don’t know how far back to go, and I don’t want to date myself, but here we go. I’m kind of an early adopter: I got into web development around 1994. Heavily involved in the Web 2.0 space for a long, long time. I was involved with a lot of startups, and a lot of it also involved a lot of larger organizations helping out with the I.T. side and web development side.  So I went through that ringer for a decade or two, became more and more interested in the notion of what tech startups were all about, or they're trying to achieve, and how were they speaking to their constituents and what kind of value were people deriving from these things, versus the value that they were putting into them. And found that I didn't like some of the answers, those coming up with.

**Richard Brown:**

**[1:33]** And so I became more and more interested in the co-op space. There was a burgeoning movement in the early 2000s around sustainability and how do we ensure that people that are providing value to an organization are seeing commensurate value coming back to them, and how to get some agency in the decision-making process? And is it possible to have a worker-owned technology company or startup?** ** We are a group of peers, and I were very interested in that question. We started an organization called Stocksy United to explore that, which is a stock photography co-op on the Internet. 1500 photographers getting providing value to the organization, but also receiving a vast majority that value it back out again. That was a really fun experiment. Did that for a few years and around that time I was sort of radicalized into the Ethereum space.

**Richard Brown:**

**[2:31]** And so I watched a few YouTube videos from Andreas Antonopoulos and went down the rabbit hole became absolutely obsessed with this notion that for the first time that I'm aware of tooling existed that allowed the implementation of some of these things that I was very interested in: community building, collective organization, governance collective ownership of organizations. All of these things were suddenly made possible through clever application of incentives and smart contracts. I went down that rabbit hole very deeply. I discovered an organization that was just sort of coming into its own called MakerDAO, joined them, became the head of community at MakerDAO, and had the opportunity to watch that organization go from people hanging out in TeamSpeak to the behemoth that it eventually became three years later. And also, that gave me sort of a front row seat to start answering some questions at the beginning of this DAO journey that we all seem to be very interested in these days.

**Richard Brown:**

**[3:39]** How do you create frameworks and how do you create ground for people to derive value and contribute value to protocol? How do you coordinate large groups of aligned actors on the Internet together? How do you ensure that they're receiving value from the protocol as well as contributing value to the protocol? How do you set up grants programs? How do you govern collectively? A lot of these questions were brand new when we were thinking about them at Maker, and so we came up with things like, we should maybe have a forum, or what if we had weekly calls where we talked about governance? What if there was some way that people could vote on stuff and so it was exciting being part of that early journey that all led up to present day.** **I suppose where, after I left Maker, I had some conversations and landed on this notion of taking all the things that we sort of learned there with building communities and applying it to some more broadly applicable challenges that the Web3 space faces in general. And that's how SCRF came about and the germination of it.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[4:42]** Yeah, and that's sort of a perfect transition into, I know something that Chris from our team wanted to hear us chat about a little bit, which was sort of what was the original idea, or the original impetus that spawned what became SCRF.

**Richard Brown:**

**[4:57]** That is a great question, and I can always count on Chris to come up with great questions. And so this is how it got kicked off after I left Maker, I had about a week and a half to take a deep breath, [to] consider playing some video games before I started having some conversation with Sergey Nazarov from Chainlink. Sergey had chatted previously about community and the importance of community.

**Richard Brown**:

**[5:23]** When he found out that I was a free agent, we got together to discuss what comes next, and so we tossed around a lot of ideas. We had a lot of conversations about what kind of opportunities the space presented, what kind of challenges the space was experiencing. And how we could create something that would solve some of those.

**Richard Brown:**

**[5:44]** And as we were running through our laundry list of challenges, we both sort of aligned on this same notion. And it's something that's been bothering him for a long time. Sergey is very academically focused, and Chainlink, his organization has a deep research culture through granting programs and through working with early, early-stage projects, trying to help get them bootstrapped [he] was constantly sort of confused about this challenge of, is there research out there? Is there institutional knowledge in other organizations? Are there places where industry can go to find out whether this has been tried before or what can we learn from the people who have gone before us? So, when I ask teams, have you done the research? Generally, the answer was no, and we don't know how. And that those are all legitimate responses because I've been through a lot of startups myself.

**Richard Brown:**

**[6:47]** And when I look back in my history, there's been plenty of time where I thought to myself, well, this is interesting. We're going to try something here. But it's my suspicion that it's been tried before, or at least somebody thought about it. If only there was some way that I could go to the source of all this wisdom.

**Richard Brown:**

**[7:01]** If I go to academia, if I go to these think tanks, if I go to researchers and have some way to find out is the thing that industry is attempting. Has that been thought of in academia? So how do we connect the industry in academia together? So there's a reciprocal relationship, and obviously this is connecting industry and academia as a phrase.

**Richard Brown:**

**[7:22]**  It's well-worn, people have  been thinking about this for a long time, but it sort of loops back to my previous a-ha moments where maybe in this brave new blockchain world, that we live in this Web3 world, maybe the primitives exist that create some alignments between these two groups where we can actually put some things into practice, incentivize them, and then reward people for meritorious actions.

**Richard Brown:**

**[7:45]** And so this this is sort of where SCRF was born. How do we take the data and the challenges in the use case and the experience of industry in all of these domains in the crypto space and match them up with ethnographers and linguists and political scientists and sociologists and privacy researchers? There's institutional knowledge in academia that needs to be tapped, and there's data and research and results in industry that need to be tapped as well.

**Richard Brown:**

**[8:18]** And so SCRF was sort of born out of that notion that we need to facilitate this connection between these two great peoples and figure out what comes out of that and how could be supported.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[8:31]** Yeah, and I wonder because, you know, obviously on the surface of it, MakerDAO was one of the first, I guess in modern parlance of DeFi projects before DeFi was a term that was slung around actively. Meanwhile, SCRF is much more of a nonprofit effort in supporting research. How different was the process of starting community in one versus the other?

**Richard Brown:**

**[8:52]** There was a surprising number of alignments actually. So, in crypto we're generally, I am speaking for the rest of crypto here, so I'm sure I could be convinced or argued with, but there isn't a lot of revenue pressures in the crypto world. We live in a very opportunity rich environments. It probably won't always be this way, but it is now.

**Richard Brown:**

**[9:13]** And so there's still this crypto anarchic, egalitarian sort of kind of co-op model throughout crypto where we have the table is big enough that we can all step up to the buffet and there isn't a lot of competition there isn't a lot of revenue pressure. And so even with these, these larger protocols, the environment is more collaborative and supportive than it would be in a traditional business.

**Richard Brown:**

**[9:41]** And so there isn't a ton of difference between the two. And partially, I wanted to craft the community ecosystem at Maker is being slightly decoupled, so it's an add on to the protocol, not a core part of the actual foundation. And so, the work that we did was very sort of community based in order to create a vibrant environment that ended up supporting that protocol.

**Richard Brown:**

**[10:05]** And so a lot of those mechanisms translate very effectively into an organization whose mandate is 100% altruistic and agnostic and doesn't have revenue pressures that lead us down one path to the other.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[10:22]** And so if, if I remember correctly, the forum itself kind of went up a bit over a year ago, I think it was late January early February, 2021, the forum started rolling out and I know there was kind of an initial team around it and community that you and some others had already started building and now it's sort of just a year past that mark.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[10:42]** I know I only started working part time here in April last year and came on full time last summer, but what do you see as kind of some of the  things that you were most excited to see given this first year of progress? 

**Richard Brown:**

**[10:55]** Yeah, that's another interesting question. So let’s go back to the initial premise of SCRF is connect industry and academia together. And so that is a lofty goal. That leads to the next question. Immediately. Well, the first question I would ask if somebody presented it to me is, okay, but how? And so it's the okay, but how part of it which I think is most fascinating in the way that we're doing that how is through a series of experiments, we need to figure out what works.

**Richard Brown:**

**[11:22]** We need to figure out what our stakeholders are looking for, what the ecosystem is interested in. And you match that up with some of our assumptions about where the ecosystem might be going. Once we have a sense of all these things, then we can begin to make some programs and connect the right individuals together. And do some experiments.

**Richard Brown:**

**[11:40]** And the key here is it's an experimentation process. That's the part that I find most fascinating is engaging with the community and the people that have been attracted to the mission of SCRF and listening to the ideas that people come up with. So how do we get information from demographics that traditionally, have been left out of this sort of North American centric crypto world that we tend to live in?

**Richard Brown:**

**[12:06]** So regional grants it's been a fascinating one for me. So, let's take a look at Latin America. Let's take a look at Southeast Asia, take a look at West Africa, and let's try to make some inroads to find out what are people doing there with blockchain and then get some of that information and bring it back to the rest of the ecosystem.

**Richard Brown:**

**[12:24]** That's been a fascinating journey, the process of discovering novel and actionable research in the Web3 space and figuring out some of the challenges around what we've been calling the last mile challenges. So how do we take this innovative research, this usable research, this novel research that exists in academia and (a) find it (b) talked to the people that wrote it and (c) figure out how we can reduce some of the frictions of making it more discoverable and accessible to industry.

**Richard Brown:**

**[12:58]** So what are the challenges there? So, this comes back to the experimentation part where we have a real problem statement, but we don't necessarily know what the source of those problems are. And so, discovering what are the friction points between industry and academia and how do we connect them together?

**Richard Brown**

**[13:14]** And once we do connect them, what are they looking for? And what are the requirements around this content? Those are the things that I find most fascinating. And we've done a lot of really interesting things watching the community researchers and academics and industry interact with each other on the forum is a process of discovering what those requirements are. And that's also been super rewarding for me to watch.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[13:39]** Yeah, absolutely. And I know I can just mention from my perspective because when I started first dabbling with SCRF, I was still working at Carnegie Mellon University at the time and working in that kind of environment, you know, I can very much vouch for the whole idea of oh connect industry and academia not being the most novel mission at its, at its surface level.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[14:00]** And I even jokingly kind of say, especially when I talk to academics of like, oh, we're here to connect industry and academia I'm sure you've never heard that one before, and that always gets a good chuckle out of them because they're like, yeah, we get that. There's a lot of people playing that game. And the thing that attracted me to SCRF, aside from getting to work with some awesome folks, yourself included, was the experimentation angle and the fact that like, hey, we're not pretending we know the answer here, but we are actively ready to experiment and figure out what can actually drive the most value and try to let it come out of a series in a landscape of experimentation.

**Richard Brown:**

**[14:31]** Yeah, it's the intention. It's a noble intention and this also speaks to the one of the core philosophies of SCRF is that we're not here to tell people what the truth is. We're not here to discover the path to the truth. We're here to facilitate actors in the space that are working towards these things. And so, how do we find other organizations that are attempting to solve the how do you publish research in a way that's likely to be read.

**Richard Brown:**

**[15:02]** So let's talk to those people, find out what they need to find out how we can collaborate, how do we find original research? That's not a new question that people have been experimenting with this for a long time. How do we do it in a way that speaks to (a) the crypto space that we're trying to support and how do we speak to the academics that are crypto curious and the crypto people that are research curious and aligned or inclined to interact with each other and how do we facilitate that stuff?

**Richard Brown:**

**[15:33]** So, we have the problem statement. The actual rubric is something that we're still experimenting with, and it's been a fascinating turn.

**Eugene Leventhal**

**[15:42]** And I guess just to plug another project that's doing cool things in that realm of just experimenting with how to give out funding to researchers. I know Experiment Foundation is about to run an experiment where I think they got roughly a half million dollars in the hand of scientists to fund different science projects. And it's cool that there is these sort of pockets of experimentation and I think kind of segueing to where SCRF today and what are we all about at the moment, you know, thinking of how to be that coordination and facilitation layer across the different areas of activity where we can experiment of how to add value.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[16:17]** I think that will also segue into what I'm sure we'll touch on DeSci a little bit. But just in general, thinking of how do we not just reinvent the wheel, as you were saying when you first forayed into the space overall, but how can we actually intentionally try to fill the gaps that are present in the landscape and I guess on that note, how do you currently think about over viewing what SCRF is?

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[16:38]** You know, like whenever you have to give an elevator pitch of SCRF, like how do you position it in terms of what we're up to here?

**Richard Brown**

**[16:44]** This  is where it gets a little circular, I suppose, but in a pleasing way. So, I have a bad tendency of saying that's number one job of SCRF and or at the core output of SCRF and then I change it on a week to week basis. And if I'm going to continue that trend because it amuses me.

**Richard Brown**

**[17:03]** But one of the core principles of SCRF is also to be reactionary. So, we were catering to and supporting the requirements of the crypto space and anybody familiar with that crypto space knows that it is tremendously dynamic, it changes month to month, year to year. Last year is almost unrecognizable. We have to stay on top of trends. And this when SCRF started out, we had sort of this, narrow vision.

**Richard Brown**

**[17:32]** How do we connect industry and academia together? Let's find good research let’s summarize it, let's broadcast that information, let’s engage with the researchers and then let's talk to industry and then begin that reciprocal process. But happily, and this is part of the opportunity rich environment I was talking about earlier is that the crypto space has evolved rapidly all around us and we are seeing emerging subcultures and groups of individuals that are also highly focused on the research space and the academic space and all the rest.

**Richard Brown**

**[18:06]** And so happily ours our scope has expanded to sort of welcome those other groups and also for us to join them as well. So you've already you already mentioned DeSci. So this is a great example of parallel discovery, I think, where we had our original mission and it turns out that academics, industry, think tanks, publishers, they're having these same realizations that the world is ready for some additional alternatives.

**Richard Brown**

**[18:41]** And so perhaps there's tooling available in the crypto world. There's paradigms, there's actors that are interested in solving for the same sort of generalized problems as SCRF is. And so it's become a far more vibrant space in the last six to eight months than we'd ever imagined when we started it.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[19:00]** Absolutely. And I guess to, dive into a little bit of where we're where things do stand today on the SCRF side, you know, we kind of as already mentioned, even in the name Smart Contract Research Forum, The Forum, and what we do on there is very much at the core of kind of who we are and what we're about in order to be able to facilitate those long term conversations, to incentivize folks to make their research more accessible and to actually have both community and wider engagement around these research ideas as the starting point for us to find the right homes for it and the right connections on the industry side and to always be thinking of how do we share the research ideas and in digestible ways, and how do we get it connected to folks who actually need those ideas.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[19:39]** And I guess just using that as a starting off point to think about the five verticals, or at least as we keep breaking it down over the five sort of parts of SCRF so far, do you mind kind of filling in the gaps there and what you see as the other core parts of it beyond just the form itself?

**Richard Brown:**

**[19:55]** Yeah, that's well, I might turn this question back on to you because this is an interesting dynamic we have where you're interviewing me, but you're also critically important part of the SCRF machine. So I would like to hear your opinions as well. But the way that we as we're trying to formalize the ways in which we can support the ecosystem and how do we find the actors that need to speak to once over demographics, the other side or demographics of the industry in academia, how do we connect them together?

**Richard Brown:**

**[20:23]** How do we begin to discover what it is that they require? How do we continue, I should say, to find whether somebody else in the space is providing those needs or whether we can help facilitate those things? It's that the number of combinations that you can draw between all of these different stakeholders is a little daunting.

**Richard Brown:**

**[20:43]** So, the way that we're sort of framing these things is we have internally at SCRF, we have sort of divided our efforts up into a few different categories. And those categories are one big grouping is around content. So obviously when we’re trying to figure out this or identify this information or connect these individuals together, they’re going to produce some kind of output is critically important to this organization that as we get those outputs, we release them back into the comments in a way that they’re likely to be discovered and engaged with.

**Richard Brown:**

**[20:19]** So we have a lot of initiatives around locating good research, promoting that good research, distilling that good research into formats that are likely to be ingested by extremely busy industry participants that content grouping speaks directly to the next sort of area of expertise that. We're trying to bring to the table that is around engagement and so generating content, but having it reside in a lonely GitHub or a dusty old filing cabinet or some PDF in somebody's personal computer doesn't do a lot of people very much good.

**Richard Brown:**

**[22:05]** So that one of the key components of discovering this useful and innovative research is ensuring that we bring it to the ecosystem and facilitate some engagement around it. So how do we craft a conversation and that is likely to produce results? How did peers interact with this information and contributing to the value of it and doing some constructive criticism in hopefully civil and if not polite manner that encourages other actors to come into the system and begin debating the merits of the content that we're finding.

**Richard Brown:**

**[22:42]** The third step here is that we want to ensure that once these engagements and improvements or additions to the research that we're finding or the inputs that our industry might be bringing to us, how do we ensure that other people are made aware of these things? And so this is another piece of the puzzle where we were just at ETHDenver where I'm going to be dating this interview a bit, but I think that this is a commonality.

**Richard Brown:**

**[23:10]** So that's universal. I was talking to numerous teams about their projects and what it is about their projects that were novel. From a research perspective, what did you invent that the rest of the ecosystem should know about and how can we get the ecosystem excited about this technology? So maybe they can use it as well. And it became obvious to me that as I was going down this line of tables that literally the people at this table here should have been talking to the people two tables over, but they had no idea what those people were actually up to.

**Richard Brown:**

**[23:41]** And so this is one of the core problems we need to solve. So as we distill their research and their content into sort of actionable or digestible pieces, and then we bring that into a forum or a platform where it can be engaged with how do we handle the discovery of that content? This is another major initiative of ours  that we sort of roll this thing up.

**Richard Brown:**

**[24:05]** I'm not sure whether I said this, but it's the last mile problem for research. So creating the research is great. The last mile is interacting with it. Letting people know that it exists and ensuring that it is being used. And so, the content, engagement, discovery all these components go together to hopefully solve some of that problem and within all of those buckets.

**Richard Brown:**

**[24:30]** We have the experimentation that we’re talking about earlier. So what projects, what kind of grants programs, what kind of frameworks do we apply to each one to sort of incentivize the ecosystem to engage with us?

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[24:39]** And then we obviously have some activities starting with content at kind of the center and very much at the at the center of our universe here. In terms of the Forum, we have the engagement layer and thinking how do we get the activity around it? How do we get build a healthy community around it? How do we onboard people into that community next rung out as sort of on the discovery side?

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[24:58]** How do we amplify this into the world and just let them know? And we also have outreach and operations as sort of strategic partnership building and thinking through, you know, like you were just mentioning with the kind of organizations we could be connecting with. And I know one of the things that we'll be reviewing at some point soon is what is our actual concrete outreach plan and going into having formal direction rather than just being reactionary there and managing both sides of it.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[25:25]** But it's interesting to think how I feel like at this point at SCRF, there's the  core operational part which is still involves a lot of experimentation and exploring and building. And we also kind of have this special projects bucket on the side where it's sort of new activities is that we are excitedly yet cautiously approaching because we think that they can deeply enhance what we're trying to build in terms of our core operations here.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[25:53]** While also recognizing these are huge endeavors. And I'm sure we might zoom in to these. But you know, one, being around building an open peer review process for independent researchers where peer reviewers are actually compensated for their time, or what is building a decentralized research center around DAOs  and governance mean and look like or at least how do we help fill in those gaps between this very emerging and right now tremendously active DAO and governance research space, which has just been exploding or how do we actually build relationships in DeSci kind of connecting all these groups looking at research, whether it's specific in the Web3 domain or, you know, looking at just the hard sciences or kind of any scientific topic and trying to think simultaneously, how do we build bridges to the meta research community?

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[26:36]** Because we're not the first people to think about peer review, nor is anyone in DeSci. There's been groups doing this for decades and we want to make sure to learn from everyone and not just be blind to, Oh, well, if you're not using Web3 tooling, it's irrelevant. It's no, we have much to learn from anyone who's thought about these problems before.

**Richard Brown:**

**[26:56]** Yeah, that's definitely part of the challenge. And it also it's the fact that we're thinking about what is the nature of open peer review and how can we help the ecosystem frame that up in themselves and identify the challenges, speaks to the rapid maturity of the space and the need for SCRF to remain reactive. And so, six to 12 months ago, I probably wouldn't have believed anybody to say that the space would have been mature enough to actually require this type of an infrastructure at this point.

**Richard Brown:**

**[27:28]** But crypto moves fast and we are engaging with so many different actors all over the space from  researchers to publishers to faculties to industry actors, that there is a tremendous need that has become blindingly obvious, that that is a tremendous need for offering a service, or at least framing up what a service might look like for open peer review in an engaging with the ecosystem to arrive at what the requirements are and then what it would actually look like.

**Richard Brown:**

**[27:57]** This is a tremendous opportunity to sort of fill in one of these academic/crypto primitives that the space or even the DeSci space  is going to require in order to sort of bootstrap the rest of the things that are going on around us. And this is one of those really important pivot points that we're lucky enough  to be in a position to help out.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[28:20]** Absolutely, and that, I think, leads nicely to I know we got a few questions from some teammates and community members. I just want to make sure to pepper at least some of those in there but one that came up was what is the most pressing problem space in Web3, that SCRF is not yet in a position to be able to facilitate, but that we should be building towards entering in the near future.

**Richard Brown:**

**[28:39]** Yeah, that is actually a very spicy question. I need to wing this one. So here's part of the challenge, I think, is that the scope of challenges ahead of us is so wide ranging that picking which challenge to do first is key and which ones we can contribute directly to coordinating on or which ones are going to be involved, just purely facilitating, like helping, finding the actors in space that are better able to do it, getting them with other stakeholders, and then providing whatever resources we can to facilitate those things.

**Richard Brown:**

**[29:16]** And so this, this, that maybe it does come back too. I hope this isn't a dodge, but we need to be reactive to the needs of the space and the maturity of the space and the actors and the stakeholders that begin to arrive in this space and trying to anticipate that far ahead about where Web3 needs to be is enormously challenging futurism is notoriously fraught with peril.

**Richard Brown:**

**[29:38]** You know, a lot of people have a very good track record there in the crypto space. It moves so quickly that frequently. It's hard to tell as a collective, hard to understand what just happened or even happened six months ago. Sometimes it takes a while to sort all this stuff out. So as far as SCRF  goes, I think that our major challenge right now is to close the loop on this reciprocal relationship between industry and academia that we've been talking about for a long time.

**Richard Brown:**

**[30:10]** We've use it one, maybe this is too spicy for an interview, but I'll come out and say it anyways is that engaging with academia is the biggest lift that there's a lot of misconceptions about what the blockchain space is all about. There are lots of painfully accurate conceptions about what the blockchain space is all about. There's work that the blockchain ecosystem needs to do, the crypto ecosystem needs to do, in order to convey a sense of legitimacy or maturity, I suppose.

**Richard Brown:**

**[30:41]** Crypto plus academia has a four- or five-year history and not all of it has been great. And so, when we're engaging with academics primarily, one of our major challenges is to convey the sense of seriousness and legitimacy and the capacity to execute. We need to build relationships in this salted earth of projects that might have come before us and also figure out how do we translate this new and vibrant and vaguely anarchic world to crypto and try to figure out where the bridges and the connection points are between academia.

**Richard Brown:**

**[31:16]** And we spent a year and a half doing that with far greater success then I probably would have predicted that it shows us, at least me personally, the timing was right. There's an enormous demographic in academia that is willing to experiment or to approach the crypto space with cautious optimism, I suppose. And so that was one of our greatest achievements over the last year, is creating these deep relationships with a lot of very large academic institutions to close that loop.

**Richard Brown:**

**[31:49]** So we're in a position now where we can begin connecting actors from universities in Australia that are focusing on ethnography with DAOs in Latin America, that are trying to figure out how to polish up their coordination mechanisms, to speak to their own specific demographics that kind of collaboration is where we see, frankly, the magic happens when we connect deep thinkers in academia, literally in a room or within a framework or a grants program or a series of meetings or a panel with industry actors that are literally on the ground implementing the things that the academics have been thinking about.

**Richard Brown:**

**[32:30]** And we can watch that, that interplay of ideas and learning and challenges and then identify the key aspects of that kind of relationship and then figure out what comes after that. What is the next step to implement something or to do stage two of the research? That is a long-winded way of saying that this is the next challenge that SCRF is facing is closing this loop between industry and academia, figuring out what kind of magical chemistry happens when that occurs, and then facilitating the outputs of that.

**Richard Brown:**

**[33:04]** And this is where we come back to the experimentation phase. Finding out what people need and then supporting that is the next stage after that.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[33:12]** And just add to that, I mean, I think in a number of conversations that we've both been having both together and separately with other folks, it's very apparent how much of a need there is for both research facilitation between all the actors in the space, as well as how do you actually help create the environment that maximizes the probability that some research output translates into an actionable outcome within various organizations.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[33:14]** And I know the latter of the two of that actionable angle. You know, since I joined SCRF, that's always been a hey, we're not doing thing just for the sake of research. We're doing it for the sake of actionable outcomes on the back of research and how do we actually make positive change happen. And I think the whole idea of in (a) how do we keep experimenting to do that better, but how do we especially in the current landscape where, you know, as of mid-March, 2022, it seems that anyone who's heard the word DAO for more than a year is somehow officially a DAO expert and a leading consultant in the DAO space.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[34:13]** And, you know, all of a sudden there’s dozens of organizations that are popping up claiming up to do DAO research. And I know we’re connected to a dozen or two that are that are genuinely doing amazing work. But the lack of coordination and it makes sense just because everyone is so busy with the work that they’re actually doing.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[34:33]** But who actually helps? You know, like you were saying with the example at ETHDenver, of like, hey, you and those that other group over there, y'all are doing essentially the same thing with potentially a slightly different twist. You should at least talk to each other and be aware of each other's projects. And I think kind of going from trying to just do the facilitation and just do more of that actionable translation into what does it look like when these actually come together.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[34:57]** And, you know, it kind of comes back to this whole idea of this large DAO research project that we want to support. Yeah, that's one that we even need to ramp up towards and get ready for, and that's going to be its own. I keep saying it's its own very exciting, but still a monstrosity of a challenge. Just given how many moving parts there are, how many people, personalities, egos, etc., and to figure out how to add that kind of catalytic energy going from thought output to actionable outcomes of some kind is still elusive in its own right and something we continuously try to get closer and closer to having an answer of how to do that better. 

**Richard Brown:**

**[35:34]** That's part of the vibrancy or the excitement that I think or at least I personally feel in this space is that there's no other industry that you can consider that is inventing itself as it goes along. It is this vibrant is sort of as an example. What is it six years ago, joining MakerDAO and then at some point a few months afterwards asking, hold on, what is the DAO part though?

**Richard Brown:**

**[35:59]** What does that actually mean? And then we're not exactly sure. What does that mean? Now and here we are six years later, we're narrowing in on it. And I'm not really sure I've seen the definitive definition of what a DAO actually is or really a clear example that someone can point me to. And so that's not an indictment.

**Richard Brown:**

**[36:17]** That's, that's fascinating. That presents an opportunity that people are unlikely to experience at this scope again. Possibly, or maybe hopefully, who knows? That’s a different discussion. But if we can all figure out, if SCRF can take a role in bringing all the actors and providing some clarity and some sense making to some of these larger questions, then I feel like we've done something important.

**Richard Brown:**

**[36:39]** We don't need to come up with the answer and give the answer to the world of what a DAO is, that's not our role. But being a part of the process where the ecosystem has begun to come up with some standards or some  categories, or what around what DAOs could mean or what collective action can mean or what privacy means or what the implication of that is.

**Richard Brown:**

**[37:04]** There's crypto plus access is almost crypto plus anything, but there's a wide range of activities that are opportunities for us to help out the space. And I think that that actually I don't change topics here, but it's something to consider too, is that when one of those special things that SCRF kind of brings to the space is the fact that we don't have that revenue model, that we are agnostic and we're chain agnostic, project agnostic, region agnostic.

**Richard Brown:**

**[37:35]** We have no horses in this race, right? We have my new business, but we are very invested in ensuring that resources continue and so races continue. So, we want to support this discovery process and that gives us an opportunity to bring supporting infrastructure in organizational infrastructure and platform infrastructure in an agnostic manner to anybody who wishes to participate.

**Richard Brown:**

[**38:00]** And so a lot of these are very nascent organizations which are doing deep dives into the philosophy behind some aspect of crypto, don't necessarily have all of the infrastructure and the resources in place to fully explore those things. On their own or connect with these other players that could also contribute having the opportunity to do that for the space at SCRF, I think is tremendously important and rewarding.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[38:29]** Absolutely. Yeah. And I also want to jump to one of the questions that we got from Lorretta in terms of what are some of our reach goals at SCRF and how do we envision some kind of pathways in getting towards those reach goals?

**Richard Brown:**

**[38:46]** It's another tough one. Maybe I'm going to put you on the spot for your answer to this question is because mine is going to be unsatisfying. Our reach, so we've thought about this a lot internally. So how do we actually measure success when our mission is sort of squishy? It's this kind of ill defined. We want things to be better.

**Richard Brown:**

**[39:05]** We want Web3 to be able to get smarter, faster than it would have in our absence. And so what does that actually mean? What does it actually look like? If we were building widgets, I would say, well, the widgets are more efficient where we produce more widgets. 36% more widgets next year. It's easy for trying to make things better or help facilitate or support or incentivize or grant and doing it in a way that is reactive to the needs of the system or the ecosystem as the ecosystem evolves is very difficult to point to a specific outcome.

**Richard Brown:**

**[39:44]** So I tend to fall back on this idea of notable wins. If we can look back in six months and say to ourselves that this manifesto that has enflamed the space was largely facilitated or partially facilitated by SCRF wouldn't have happened if we weren't there to help out. That was a huge win for me, and whether anybody else knows it or not doesn't really matter.

**Richard Brown:**

**[40:10]** Or a team of researchers were funded that we funded them to do something that actually improves this project or this area of expertise of this problem space and we helped kick off those careers or supported or mentored those individuals into greater successes. Those are the notable wins. But trying to identify them ahead of time as a super typhoon.

**Richard Brown:**

**[40:34]** So maybe if I had to be forced to come up with some, I would like to have a platform, a forum where civil, intelligent, lively conversation happens around novel and actionable and useful in researching the space. Industry actors are excited about the things they find. The researchers are excited to have the opportunity to contribute that we've helped facilitate a framework or an ecosystem or DAOs or something that allows independent researchers to enjoy some of the benefits of peer review that they might not have access to outside of the traditional academic world. That would be great.

**Richard Brown:**

**[41:17]** That we have facilitated one or more projects and giving them the resources that they need to achieve greater clarity around any one of the eight major categories that we're looking at from auditing security, to governance mechanism design, to privacy, to what have you that we've helped push the space forward in a way that people can look back on.** **Things are better now like I said, I can't point to 36% more efficient widgets because it's beyond my comfort zone to predict what the future might hold but maybe Eugene is comfortable in doing it.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[42:03]** We're using 36% more efficient knowledge. Yeah. I think it's an interesting one to think about. For me, one of the elements that you were kind of alluding to and touching on that gets me really excited is how do we create a stronger link between problem generation and the potential problem solvers or problem statement generation such as generating problems, problem statement generation and connecting with the right set of.

**Richard Brown:**

**[42:27]:** Yes, we don’t want to be generating problems. 

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[42:29]** Yeah, I mean, if that was our goal, we should be playing a whole different game. That would be fun, but disastrous. But yeah, I mean, I think the idea of right, if you look at different knowledge areas now or you take any educational discipline of computer science or engineering or, you know, whatever subset there are different forms of how the most pressing problems in the space get surfaced or shared and rarely is a genuinely coordinated across the entire space.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[42:57]** And you know, in certain disciplines will be a certain actor organizes a certain convening and outputs a research statement, white paper that they share with the NSF and government funding agencies or things like that, or some domains are so small that people just all know each other and it’s like, well, call those five people and then you got everyone you need to talk to because there’s only 500 of us on the whole planet.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[43:18]** And I think it's interesting to try to create from the event perspective, from the tooling perspective, and the community perspective, which community and culture inherently deeply linked. But how do you across these different areas realize how to generate problems and then get those problems into the hands of people who have the chance or the capability and skills to solve them, while also connecting them with the funders who are in the position to potentially help it scale up if  scaling is realistically feasible there.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[43:49]** And on that note, kind of being aware of where does it make sense to scale versus where do things need to stay very small and if anything, you keep replicating small communities around very focused groups instead of trying to get, you know, like the one master research group to solve all the research problems globally, like that would be a disaster.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[44:07]** So that’s another one that comes to mind in terms of an exciting thing that we will hopefully get to play our part in making better.

**Richard Brown:**

**[44:15]** There’s a lot of interesting tensions here. One of the tensions that I’m constantly sort of top of mind for me is that this actionable idea and so we have that part of I going to do it again. One of the major outputs of SCRF is to act as a translation layer. So as we’re trying to connect individuals or groups and faculties and industry together is we kind of have three different levels of translation happening.

**Richard Brown:**

**[44:42]** We need to understand the expectations and the paradigms in the academic world and speak a language that they can kind of understand. We need to understand that the outputs and the expectations of industry and we also need to understand how crypto puts its own expression, special spin on these things without having one of these three areas drown out the others.

**Richard Brown:**

**[45:03]** And we also discover that there’s different expectations. And so in academia, there’s an environment there that promotes diligence and deep thinking, and the academia lives in a different temporal reality than industry does, where you can think about something for once or years. And then once you come to some conclusions you’re satisfied with and you can publish in industry potentially you have three weeks to figure out a solution to the problem once you have something together and hope for the best or you just don’t do it.

**Richard Brown:**

**[45:39]** So there’s different outputs and different pressures and trying to speak to the strengths of all of these groups. And what crypto is just pure chaos at all times. And people are just trying to figure out what’s going on around them. Loving it, but it’s very candid. So how do we bring some more of this actionable mentality to the process but keep that diligence in the academic world and then figure out how we can have those two groups collaborate and then throw in the old crypto or Web3 spend where it’s useful and then provide an output is a is a constant challenge. And that’s a fascinating aspect for me, figuring out where the comfort zone is between all of these different demographics.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[46:26]** And so I guess as we're getting ready to wrap up, it feels only appropriate if we also put on the actionable lens to this podcast and think of what is some kind of call to action for anyone who might hear this. And obviously there's the element of, hey, what we're doing here is new and we still need more folks to help us build what we're trying to build and to, yeah, feel free to reach out to us or to hop in our Discord and see what ways there are to contribute to all the exciting things we're trying to build. And yeah, I was just wondering if there were any specific calls to action that were on your mind in terms of anyone who might happen to come across this?

**Richard Brown:**

**[47:04]** Sure. It's going to be tough because we've talked about a lot of foggy notions. So we want to make things better. We want to help people, we want to facilitate them, we want to connect them. So, what does that actually mean? That's a good question. And so I talked about some of the experimentation if you want to know what our experiments are all about, though, here's good news for you, is that we're fantastically resource constrained as far as people go.

**Richard Brown:**

**[47:30]** And so we need people desperately to not only bring their ideas to the table and their projects and their initiatives and let us know about them, but also to contribute to ours and so we have grants programs, we fund original research, at least four different shows in there. We have regional grants programs where we want to surface use cases and studies from areas of the world where people are actually doing blockchain and they're actually needed, which is, you know, provide some interesting results we need to know about that stuff.

**Richard Brown:**

**[48:00]** We have we're looking for researchers and independent researchers to join us and help us evaluate and surface fascinating research in the space, summarize it and then bring it back to the ecosystem and also to engage with the public or we are doing or trying to understand the notion of what open peer review looks like. And so, we need peer reviewers in the space to provide us with some insight.

**Richard Brown:**

**[48:25]** We need industry to tell us what they are looking for or what independent researchers looking for. Lots of stakeholders. We need project managers. We need to team leads. So if you're interested in crypto Web3, you have an academic bent to your thinking or a history with academia, you're energized by some of the problems that we're thinking about.** **Please join us in the chat I guarantee you we'll find a space for you, fairly rapidly.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

Absolutely. And we'll make sure it.

**Richard Brown:**

Maybe you should add on too. Is as enough. From an operations perspective, we what do you think we should be? People's takeaway should be here.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[49:07]** Yeah, I mean, as we were talking about in our ops meeting this morning, the hiring side is a tremendous priority for us. You know, I think that we're actively working on, tinkering with our community structure, how we use our community call, the nature of onboarding here and, you know, talk to any decentralized environment. Onboarding is a persistent challenge given how quickly the space is moving, how fast things are changing.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[49:27]** So, I mean massive plus one to all of that. What you said on the resourcing side, you know, I think even for folks who might not be interested in either jumping in in a more committed kind of fashion, but are just interested in the topics of how to improve research, how to improve review, we're just very happy to always hear your feedback.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[49:48]** We'll make sure to post a link to our project board in the show notes of this as well. And that way you can actually just jump in or GitHub and see all the things that are on the move for us right now. And not just have to talk to someone on the team and hear what our perspective is in general because we use GitHub for our actual project management.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[50:02]** So, you can just get a glimpse of what's going on internally at any given point. And yeah, I mean, operationally, I think one of the big things as we try to figure out how to provide more value on the actionable on converting research to actionable outcomes, if you work in industry and you are seeing persistent problems, are experiencing persistent problems that you want more researchers paying attention to, please highlight that to us.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[50:28]** And you know, we're not asking to  contribute to any funds or anything like that. We're in a position, fortunately, where we are able to support with granting. So if anything, we just need to have more directions to be sent in to say, hey, here's an area of problems that the industry is experiencing. Help us experiment around how we can solve those problems more quickly.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[50:46]** And that's exactly the kind of value we're trying to provide to the to the ecosystem in the Web3 space. So yeah, whether you're looking for roles yourself, you just want to provide some feedback or you think you have tangible problems that need to be solved, please make sure to put that on our radar and we will be greatly appreciative of it.

**Richard Brown:**

Well said. 

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[51:07]** Yeah, perfect. And I think that's a good place for us to wrap up for the day. And so, yeah, as always, pleasure chatting Rich and yeah, we'll have more information on how to connect with both of us and SCRF in the show notes. So I hope you enjoy the rest of your day wherever you are in the world.

**Richard Brown**

Thanks a lot.
