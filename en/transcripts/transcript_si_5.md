**Chris Berg:**

**[00:13]** Hi, my name is Chris Berg, I'm from the RMIT Blockchain Innovation Hub at RMIT University in Melbourne. I'm a cryptoeconomist, and I'm really excited to be joined by – in fact, my colleague, Professor Jason Potts from the RMIT Blockchain Innovation Hub –  Hi, Jason. \

**Jason Potts:** 

**[00:31]** Good morning Chris, it's good to be here.

**Chris Berg:**

**[00:33]** And I'm also excited to welcome to this conversation about treasury management, Scott Moore from Gitcoin. Hi, Scott. 

**Scott Moore:**

**[00:41]** Hey you all, good to be here.

**Chris Berg:**

**[00:43]** I'd like to actually just ask a little bit about each of your backgrounds, so that we've got some context and so that the viewers have some idea about where you're coming from and how you've approached the questions of treasury management. I'll throw it to you first Scott. So you're deeply involved in the Gitcoin project, of course. How does Gitcoin and your background in Gitcoin help you think about, sort of, treasury management and how we spend the funds that we have in these enormous blockchain treasuries?

**Scott Moore:**

**[01:13]** So I think with Gitcoin, the particular thing to note is our mission has always been to grow and sustain digital public goods across Web3. And so, in terms of our treasury, we actually take a particularly broad view of what counts as relevant for spending, and that includes things that might not be traditionally thought of as part of the Gitcoin ecosystem. That includes things like matching pools for various sorts of quadratic funding and includes things like partnerships with projects like Verses, which are aimed at trying to sort of help Web3 articulate its values.

**Scott Moore:**

**[01:51]** And, more generally, I think, you know, we're one of the larger DAOs in terms of total treasury. And so, although we have to be prudent, I think that gives us sort of an impetus to be experimental, to try things, to work with the community and actively try to find ways to make it useful in the world. I think those are, at least, the first things that come to mind. But for me treasury management is almost less about management and more about mission. It's more about how do we actually achieve the things that we want to see in the world?

**Chris Berg:**

**[02:29]** So, Jason, what do you think about? I really like that idea. It's not about management, it's about mission. So why don't I step back and then just ask you: from an economic perspective, what is the purpose of the treasury itself?

**Jason Potts:**

**[02:44]** Yeah, so treasury is obviously a public good, it's a local public good or as economists sometimes say, a club good. So, a group of people come together and they need to create a collectively shared resource that benefits them all, and the treasury is a solution to that problem of how you have collective ownership of something that everyone will benefit from. Now, by definition, that's going to require agreement and coordination, which means governance and that sort of solution to this problem of creating a collective resource that benefits members of a community but enables the community to hold each other accountable for contributions to it, to monitoring, to the maintenance of it, and crucially to the development of that collective resource. 

**Jason Potts:**

**[03:31]** Now, treasury is a sort of corporate version of that same object, but we also have other solutions too. Governments have national treasuries where all the citizens of a nation collectively contribute taxes into a common pool, then we make collective decisions about that; that's called politics, that sort of political decision-making requires administration. That's the civil service or various agencies and so on that builds those, often infrastructures or collectives of action. We live in a world where we have lots of big solutions to that big problem. What we don't have is well-developed solutions to this new problem of what does this look like in a digital world and what does this look like when we're not all from the same country?

**Jason Potts:**

**[04:22]** We haven't met each other? We lack these other sort of governance institutions that would normally be used to control us, such as voting or identity registries or other sort of systems. My area is - I'm an innovation economist. I specialize in the economics of new technologies and so on. But, I also do a lot of work on institutional and public economics, which is really, how do you solve these public goods problems? What's absolutely fascinating about DAO and Treasury Management is this intersection of this new technological world that requires a new solution to an old problem. 

**Jason Potts:**

**[04:57]** So what we're seeing is just this explosion of, on the one hand, experimentation. This is a blank canvas in a sense. We can program it, we can try new things. But in the other sense, we're doing this as evolved cultural beings that have been living this for individually tens of years, collectively for tens of thousands of years, trying to solve this same hard problem of how do we cooperate to create shared public resources that work, that are the ones we want to build that function for the community., and crucially, that solves the sort of common problem, that the people that benefit contribute and that we minimize the amount of freeriding in that sense.

**Jason Potts:**

**[05:37]** The reason we care about that is that these things are fragile resources. They can collapse if they're not contributed to and they can be captured. People can build the wrong stuff. If we have particularly powerful individuals within a collective taking over the allocation of the treasury, they'll build things that benefit them, not the group. So lots of hard social problems to be solved in this new technological realm.

**Chris Berg:**

**[06:00]** So Scott, Jason has described the decision-making behind how to spend the treasury as a collective decision-making problem - we need to come together as a community and figure out how to spend what is real money. When you're thinking about it from both the macro perspective, from the cryptocurrency space, but also from Gitcoin's perspective, what do you think about first and how are we going to come to these collective decisions?

**Scott Moore:**

**[06:31]** So ultimately in my view the treasury management problem in this case is best solved by the same sort of governance that we actually had a lot of trouble with, in the context of the real world, which is representative democracy, i.e. you have a set of delegates or stewards who are able to receive voting power and then make decisions that represent a broader group according to the will of the people. In the context of the UNI/COMP-like governor models that we use, or even in the context of somebody who opens up and models, a lot of that takes place in a sort of liquid democratic fashion, i.e you can at any time decide to delegate to yourself or to swap your delegates.

**Scott Moore:**

**[07:19]** That process, to me, gives a lot more flexibility than in the traditional sort of political systems we often think about in which you kind of have one say over the decision-making of the entire country in a four-year period or depending on the country, just over a relatively long amount of time. So that's one piece, is just having some form of checks-and-balances by which you can ensure that representatives are paying attention to what's happening in governance and then making decisions accordingly and that people can swap their representation accordingly.

**Scott Moore:**

**[07:52]** But the other part, I think, is figuring out ways to signal preferences, and that's what quadratic funding is kind of all about. So the way that quadratic funding works is you just take effectively the number of people that are supporting a given set of projects. You basically distribute funds proportional to the amount of sort of not funds, but rather, kind of not the number of contributions that a project gets. So you can imagine Project A gets two, $4 donations. Project B gets 8, $1 donations. The former would get a matching amount of $16. The latter would get a matching amount of $64, and you would effectively just normalize the matching amounts by the matching pool itself. So Project A would get 20% and Project B would get 80%.

**Scott Moore:**

**[08:45]** And the reason that's useful is because we've learned something in the process of people donating to these projects about their actual preferences, and they've done so. They've done the signaling in such a way that they have skin in the game, so that they actually can be sure that this is a preference that they care strongly about relative to any other options. And so that's been useful for us to deploy as a signaling or a sort of voting mechanism around funding in the Ethereum ecosystem. Something that we're using for Gitcoin itself at a very small scale right now, just as we test it in this sort of construction of new workstreams. But that's sort of the layer on top of the broader representative democratic model.

**Chris Berg:**

**[09:32]** It's interesting, though, Jason, sort of stepping back and thinking through how Gitcoin is doing it, in fact, how most DAOs are doing it. They're spending their treasury, or at least a big part of that treasury, through a grants program. So people apply to a grants program that might have a certain set of rules and will have a decision-making structure, which as Scott described in the Gitcoin context as the quadratic funding model, and then of course, they'll receive that. But there's lots of different ways that we could spend our treasury and there's lots of different justifications for why we would choose different ways.

**Chris Berg:**

**[10:10]** Now Jason, you, as a professional lifelong academic, have received grants before. Can you tell me a little bit about how you think about where grants, as a model for spending a treasury, fit into the wider ecosystem of how we would spend money and identify ways to spend money as well?

**Jason Potts:**

**[10:34]** Thanks Chris. It's a big, deep question, and I want to dig into the logic of what should grants be spent on and how should we spend them? How big should they be? But there's actually a broader point here that I think is worth addressing before we get to that. And that's the sort of, what are treasuries actually for question? And so far we've been treating them in the standard way that everyone thinks of them - they’re local public goods, they’re collective resources, the purpose of them is to build infrastructure that everyone can use. If that's the case, and especially if you're using them for research, if you want to create knowledge that will benefit the community in the future, you want to do that now. You want to bring forward as much of the spending as possible for the treasury and put it to use to create immediate value that will benefit the future.

**Jason Potts:**

**[11:20]** That's the standard model, and in many ways that is fundamental and true. But there's another model. Another way of thinking about treasuries that I think is interesting to contrast with this. To emphasize that one of the fundamental differences between a treasury that's servicing a digital economy, a blockchain, [or] a DAO, is that exit costs are relatively low. If I don't like what's going on, I can just lay back. That's not generally true in the meat-space world. I live in Australia. Technically, it's illegal for me to leave Australia right now because of COVID laws. But even if it wasn't, there are high costs of exiting the nation. I've got a lot of committed resources here. It's hard for me to do that. So that barrier to exit means that it's actually a lot easier to provide public goods because you can kind of force me to provide them, if I'm trapped here, in a sense. 

**Jason Potts:**

**[12:22]** The problem when exit costs are very low is that it's actually very difficult to build public goods because the minute I feel any costs occurring to me about the provision of them, I'm like, okay, see you, I'm gone. So either you solve that problem with culture - you just build a really strong culture and we are here together, and this is our project for us to build the thing. And you use social, cultural, identity-based reinforcement mechanisms and a strong culture that will work. But it's also exploitable; the problem with creating public goods in that context is that the exit is easy.

**Jason Potts:**

**[13:02]** So another way to think about a treasury is - a treasury is a way to raise the exit costs for a community in a world where exit is cheap. Because what I'm doing if I leave, I mean if I don't like what's going on here, if I feel a little bit of imposition, I'll leave. Except if there's a huge treasury there that I'm not going to get to share in, and the benefits from it if I leave. So that sort of interestingly and from a game-theoretic perspective, curiously creates, is that on the one hand if we're trying to create high-quality public goods that benefit us all, spend the treasury as quickly as possible. Unless we're worried about exit, in which case build the treasury up as huge as you can make it and never spend it. And it's all for the equilibrium. 

**Jason Potts:**

**[13:49]** So you've got these two situations, both of which are true. We want to spend the collective resources now because we benefit all the members of the community in the future. But we also want to maintain the community and the way this actually gets… I mean, that's not hard… where it gets hard is that the reason you want to raise the costs of exit is; if the cost of exit are high and I look at you and I know the costs of exit are also high for you, it's safe for us to invest in idiosyncratic resources. I can build some specializations, some skills or some capital that are specific to this community and you can build some complementary ones. And I know we can't exploit each other because of that, so it becomes safe to contribute to a community where you're contributing very specific resources, especially your own skills and your own development, that have no value outside the community or have less value outside of that.

**Jason Potts:**

**[14:47]** So that's the reason this is a hard problem. So, the ideal solution is you want a huge treasury, you want to spend it on targeted knowledge resources, R&D and giving grants to good people to do good things. But you also want it to be big enough and visible enough, such that everyone realizes this is a good thing. We want to stick around here and have that resource last for infinity and be a part of that. And that's why treasury management is hard. \

**Chris Berg:**

**[15:16]** I will actually come back to you in a moment Jason, on the types of grant programs. But Scott, I'll ask you first. So if we were running a DAO just as a company, there would be an executive function and that executive function would be deciding how to spend those funds according to some strategy, some vision and so forth. Through Gitcoin, and the Gitcoin community, which has built the quadratic funding mechanism, which gives us a much better understanding of the preferences of the DAO members or the preferences of the community about what should be funded in their view, based on what has been presented to the DAO for funding.

**Chris Berg:**

**[15:59]** Where do you think this works best, or alternatively, where don't you think it's succeeding in creating the sort of public goods that we as a crypto community really need, or as an Ethereum community need?

**Scott Moore:**

**[16:16]** Yeah, one thing I'll just quickly add to what Jason mentioned, which I think is interesting, is because the nature of Gitcoin is like by mission to fund public goods, we end up actually in a scenario in which, by funding more public goods, i.e. by running grants rounds which we do every quarter, we actually end up creating a positive virtuous cycle, at least as far as I can tell in which spending that treasury ends up getting further treasury funding. So you could imagine this kind of net positive effect on overall treasury size, despite spending treasury funds. That's kind of like this interesting non-investment return on capital in the sense that people are simply giving more funding to the treasury so that they can manage these quadratic funding rounds, just so that they can deploy more into public goods, without it being really any kind of investment or there being any expectation of return. 

**Scott Moore:**

**[17:15]** And I think that's a really interesting point in context of the dichotomy that you mentioned. But in terms of, the ways in which we want to see quadratic funding, I think, leveraged in the long run in the DAO, I think for me, the biggest challenge is mostly just that you have limitations on the size and scale decisions you can make with those sorts of signaling mechanisms at this moment. And partly because there's this concept, which I'm sure you're both very familiar with, like civil resistance, and ultimately, we're still testing the true robustness of civil resistance in the context of quadratic funding. So on the one hand, we've found that we're able to scale up to at least $3, $4 million in matching funds per quarter, which is like not negligible.

**Scott Moore:**

**[18:17]** And we found that we were able to do that in such a way that we're actually able to get a relatively good signal as to what people care about. If you look at the results of the rounds for the average Ethereum like average participant in the ecosystem, they seem reasonable. They seem like reasonable choices. No one would be like, that's crazy. Why did that get so much money? That happens on occasion but by and large the results make sense to people. And so although we haven't scaled this for the DAO itself, the question is still, in the condition of a DAO to your point, it is more of a cloud. Are there stronger conditions for civil attacks in that context than they would be in a broader, more disparate community? 

**Scott Moore:**

**[19:00]** We haven't gotten to the scale where we can really see that, but I think it's an interesting question that we should be aware of as we sort of scale it. There's also the question of do we at some point implement some idea of like MACI, which is this sort of anti-collusion, effectively, a way of hiding the information about a given contributor. And there are tradeoffs to that model in which, on the one hand, you get stronger civil resistance, but on the other, you run into this problem in which you don't necessarily have the same social signal from doing your donations, which you might want in order to showcase that you are in fact a productive member of a community. So, that's ultimately where we've landed so far, but we're still very much in the process of kind of iterating on these things as we go.

**Chris Berg:**

**[19:46]** And Scott, I guess it would be fair to say then, the problem with a Sybil attack on a funding regime, an individual pretending or one individual pretending to be more than one individual, would be not just sort of that it harms the signal from the community, but it could be used for rent-seeking effectively. It could be used to distort the spending or what are the considerations or what are you most worried about in that sense?

**Scott Moore:**

**[20:15]** I think there's definitely a scenario in which someone tends to gravitate towards solutions that are not really benefiting. I mean, this is the fundamental of any rent-seeking problem is really just what happens when the community starts to mostly try and vote for things to benefit, like a small group that has no real positive externalities for the broader community. And I don't think we've seen whether that's in the main rounds or whether that's in the sort of smaller rounds we've run through the DAO itself. But, I think it's certainly worth thinking about long-term, like what those scenarios might look like. One easy example might be, if you look at like what might happen if there are only three or four grants in a given round.

**Scott Moore:**

**[21:02]** If it's a very small round and there are very few participants, you can imagine people naturally gravitating towards the most popular of those individuals. And that's something, it's not solely rent-seeking, but there's a form of kind of, certainly in some form, suboptimal even if that person is providing significant value because it means that there are lots of other types of goods that are less popular that might not be as easy to basically suss out through the process of this voting. We've seen some of that, but fortunately, it hasn't been, I think, substantial enough to cause major disruptions in the rounds.

**Scott Moore:**

**[21:48]** I don't think it's the kind of thing that we formally mapped out in a way that we might want to. We kind of do this mapping after each round, where we calculate the fraud tax, which tends to be quite low, and we calculate basically collusion on that basis. But looking through what types of goods were potential attacks that didn't occur. We're in the round, but we're kind of like red herrings that weren't really impacting the community positively or had no real reason to be in that round. It's something that the grants review committee is doing that I don't think we've done a formal analysis of that scope at this point.

**Chris Berg:**

**[22:33]** So, Jason, one of the research agendas that you've had for a very long time is looking at the ways that we fund innovation and to harp back to my earlier point, I think it strikes me at least that what we're doing in DAOs and blockchain communities is that we've picked one very particular way of funding innovation or research or development, and that's the grant. But you've looked at other models as well, like for example, prizes which we're experimenting within the real economy, and tenders. Why would you choose grants or prizes or tenders? And maybe if you could sort of take us through the advantages and disadvantages of those alternatives?

**Jason Potts:**

**[23:21]** So this problem of how you fund innovation? I mean, it's a search problem. You're trying to solve “I need to invest some resources into a production process that I don't know how it's going to happen, but I want an outcome on the other side that is uncertain.” So it's an investment-under-uncertainty problem, that is the broad category of it. And that broad category of investment under uncertainty means that there are a number of different mechanisms we can use. Each mechanism trades off on different margins. So if we are trying to control fraud, if that's the main thing we're concerned about, then we just use administration. We just have an administrative hierarchy that'll go through a process, and it's checklists and so on. And we can minimize fraud that will just guarantee that we probably learn or that the investment will be okay. But there's just basically zero chance that we'll discover something fantastic here.

**Jason Potts:**

**[24:20]** If we know the problem we're trying to solve, like I need to have X… and there's a very specific engineering sense of what a solution looks like, such that I can identify it when it's solved. I can describe the problem. I just have no idea what the technology will be to solve that. Prizes, so prizes then become the mechanism, and you set the prize exactly proportional to the importance of the solution. If it's a $10,000 problem, then you set a $9,000 prize and you can guarantee that work. The problem there, though, is around: you have to be able to define what the problem is tightly, define what the solution looks like, identify it, and specify when you need the problem solved by. Not all problems fit that.

**Chris Berg:**

**[25:07]** To clarify, like a good example of a prize is: get an autonomous vehicle from one place to another place, which is easy to measure, we know it when we see it.

**Jason Potts:**

**[25:18]** By Wednesday and I need to do it not using any magical technology. So prizes sound amazing, except for… that not all problems are well specified. I don't necessarily know what a solution looks like, and I need to know who's eligible to compete in that sort of thing. So, the great thing about prizes and prizes are often used to solve: I don't know where the solution is going to come from, it might be from my community. It might be from a completely different community altogether. It might be from someone that I don't know and can therefore gather together. So, we might use a firm to solve it, when I know who's going to solve it, the people I just hired, and how they're going to solve it with the resources that they brought to be a, they just need an incentive. The money I just gave them in the instructions.

**Jason Potts:**

**[26:02]** Grants are a different one, again. Grants are basically: “Pitch me a good solution. And I've got a fixed amount of money. What type of solution can I buy for this money?” Now that's a different optimization problem because I know how much money I've got. I don't know what problem is going to be solved, but I know I'll be able to solve $10,000 worth of problems. So I just have to be really good at choosing the right problem to solve. So grants are amazing when you've got amazing prize committees that are good at identifying what they think will be a good set of inputs into a solution. And then you go away and then you will have to monitor.

**Chris Berg:**

**[26:45]** So that's the hard part, isn't it? Because with the prize, it's all exposed. But a grant has to be almost all _ex-ante_. And Scott I should bring you in here as well. And thinking about this sort of matrix of sort of when we're looking at, when we hand over the funds, when we assess whether something is being done. Have you thought at Gitcoin about, well, we hand over these funds and that's great, but how do we monitor what has been done was what was proposed or has been done at all?

**Scott Moore:**

**[27:19]** So that's actually, with quadratic funding, a huge issue to your point. But one beautiful part of quadratic funding is that, at least in the way, we model it and work with the community on it, it's iterative and it happens every quarter, which means that we have the ability to kind of see after quarters past whether or not someone's actually produced anything based on basically the community coming back and saying: hey did you do the thing? Now it doesn't really help resolve the original problem of what happens to those funds that were already distributed. Were those just gone? Is there any recovery mechanism for those? I think, ultimately, the goal should be, in my view, the community over time gets better at basically learning from those mistakes. So if a community consistently loses small amounts of capital on one of the 20 grants, they should learn, probably okay, what was wrong with that grant? Why do we make a mistake with this grant?

**Chris Berg:**

**[28:20]** Let's not give it to those guys again. 

**Scott Moore:**

**[28:22]** Not even just that. How can we give better criteria over time that exclude or restrict or reduce the probability therefore, like those grantees actually getting through to make those mistakes in the first place? And that's something we've started to see happen with the review criteria that we put in place. It's not quite there yet. I think there's a lot of room for improvement, but it's something that we found to be improving round of a round, which is nice to see.

**Scott Moore:**

**[28:52]** Now the alternative is I definitely think that we have bounties as well, which are actually the first thing that we started with as a platform. And I think the tradeoffs are: if you have to choose between as you said, like sort of like, I guess the _ex-post ex-ante_, I

think you're much worse off in the bounty prize sort of scenario because you end up with way more uncertainty around basically whether this thing will ever get solved that's proposed basically, because you don't know whether or not anyone who's going to come around with the right set of skills is going to do it for the price, within the time. And to your point, all those conditions are very much in flux.

**Scott Moore:**

**[29:36]** So when given the tradeoff, especially in a very fast-moving environment which like web3, tends to be, the preference I think usually should be towards, deploy[ing] small amounts of capital iteratively and basically leverage the results of that to deploy further capital, but always be moving forward, versus: I think there are lots of projects that actually have these RFPs that are relatively substantial, that have been sitting there for months and months and months. And in that time, if they had kind of been more proactive, it could have been something that was already solved. I don't know if I believe that in all these, there's nuance to that, of course, but that's, I think, a really important piece.

**Chris Berg:**

**[30:24]** And Scott, in that sense, as I see it, the treasury spending problem is really at the absolute heart of, if you view a DAO as a startup, in some sense, let's just say a DAO is a company, and a DAO is a startup company that needs to compete, and it just needs to get stuff out the door. And I really worry. And I wonder whether you have the same perspective that the grants communities that we have across the space are very focused on protecting small amounts of money from being spent rather than just pushing things out the doors, does that accord with your views or do you have a different perspective? \

**Scott Moore:**

**[31:06]** I definitely think that's largely true. I mean, there's again, there's nuance to it. The problem is that it's the amount of capital you're spending relative to the size of the treasury. So to your point, you don't want to deplete. Spending like a quarter of your treasury on something just as a sort of YOLO attempt at seeing whether something works is a terrible idea for obvious reasons. It's very funny. I mean, there's probably a compelling argument for the meme narrative of doing that itself being like, I'm sure someone would make the case that like, that's enough to justify some crazy expenditure for like, let's throw like, I mean, if you if you think about it. 

**Scott Moore:**

**[31:50]** I mean, a good example would be PizzaDAO. PizzaDAO only exists to throw the largest possible pizza party globally, and that is precisely what they spent the funds on. But like that is actually, I mean, one, like that’s their mandate and they executed on it. And two, it's actually something that is a good showcase of like, they spent all of their treasury extremely quickly for this particular purpose and that, funnily enough, not in a dissimilar way to what we're talking about in the Gitcoin scenario.

**Scott Moore:**

**[32:22]** Although the relative impact I would say is different perhaps. We spent it in these grants rounds, in our case, for the purpose of, one, creating these positive externalities through the production of these public goods. But in addition, with the expectation that as people see these positive externalities and benefit from them, they will be more inclined to give back. And in part, this happens in web3 communities because of the fact that we have community currencies and similar to a point that Jason mentioned, when positive externalities are produced, those currencies tend to appreciate, relatively speaking.

**Scott Moore:**

**[33:02]** It's more likely to appreciate the more there is being built, the more public goods there are to actually work. And if we didn't have the NFT infrastructure that we have now, we would never have the current bull market that we have. And I think that's sort of like an interesting part of this puzzle that I think is missing. So yeah, when treasury says, hey, there's a $20K grant off a 5 billion dollar treasury, we have to make you go through, it's kind of the same problem as government grants like we want to make you go through like 30 steps to get this grant. You're probably not going to make it as a DAO, I think relative to others who are more willing to be flexible, which incidentally, we haven't really talked too much about it, is why we tend to focus on work streams or subDAOs or committees that effectively operate independently and have more flexibility in how they spend a smaller portion of funds.

**Jason Potts:**

**[34:01]** That's a really interesting point, Scott. I think one of the key ideas that mechanism design or in a lot of the literature on the effectiveness and efficiency of various grants mechanisms have emphasized is that what you're wanting to avoid is basically too much optimization. Because the problem is, if I can see clearly how to… how the mechanism is being optimized, I can game it. And if I know that there's $10,000 up for grabs, I'm rationally going to spend $9999 getting that. And if more than one person makes that decision, we've now got a wallet auction.

**Jason Potts:**

**[34:37]** We end up having more effort and resources being put into getting the grant than actually is disbursed. And the solution to this is just to add some randomization into this. So what this looks like in practice is you absolutely minimize the grant applications to two pages, not ten pages or one page or less. You create a sort of sufficient criteria by, if you meet these basic criteria, you're probably in the running for delivering a solution, a low hurdle to get into the round. Then we randomize or we tournament and then randomize. But you just… you just mix it up a bit because the thing about randomization is it's very cheap and it's hard to game. And what I've just done is I've basically… And it also has the other benefit that grants are basically a search technology, and they usually work best when they're repeated.

**Jason Potts:**

**[35:34]** So we're dealing with an evolutionary process. We don't want that evolutionary process to channel. We want it to be searching the space as widely as possible. Again, randomization is a great way of getting out of channels and just searching spaces that you might not otherwise look to. So I think that that sort of design principle of just trying to minimize the risk of solving the problem that's immediately in front of us, not the problem we actually need to solve, ensuring that we don't end up just giving the same rewards to the same people over and over again because just for risk minimization reasons, is that some kind of algorithmic randomization into this process is actually beneficial, for the same reasons that the quadratic mechanism is amazing for just preference efficiency. And it solves that problem of how do we make the most specific preferences? Randomization solves the problem of how do we avoid the whole grant process eating itself?

**Chris Berg:**

**[36:37]** Which is a perspective that comes from years of bitterness about failed and successful grants and being pretty sure that they're random anyway, in academia. Actually, Jason, I'll stick with you because we've been using some really interesting language in this conversation. We've talked about public goods, local public goods, club goods. Club goods, of course, refers to a boundary between people who are in and out of the club. Scott's been talking about externalities quite a bit. What I'm interested in, first of all, I'll ask you Jason, is, there isn't just one DAO in the world. There are many, many, many DAOs and some of the research innovation that we might do in one DAO will have very substantial or no spillovers to other DAOs that will help the community or be just driven in.

**Chris Berg:**

**[37:26]** When we think about how we're spending treasuries, how much should we be thinking about: Is this helping web3 generally or crypto generally? Or should we be just trying to go for monopolistic benefits that just drive our competitive advantage forward?

Or is there a philosophy there or how do you think about the world of DAOs in this grant context?

**Jason Potts:**

**[37:50]** So we started this conversation by recognizing that treasuries and application grants are solving a problem of local public goods. Public goods problem for a community. A club is just a mechanism for individuals to push positive externalities onto other people. So that's what that solves. The problem you just described is just: now we nest that up into a hierarchy. An individual DAO can produce a resource for its community. but that resource for that community can itself have spillover externality benefits on other communities.

**Jason Potts:**

**[38:28]** So what is that? That's just the same problem repeated at a higher level. So this notion of nested public goods is really what we're talking about here. And fortunately, the solution is exactly the same. We just need to build grants with grants, DAOs with DAOs, public goods of public goods. And what that would look like is just a coordination mechanism that enables each individual grants program or treasury to create a higher-order treasury or grants program to solve that same problem. 

**Jason Potts:**

**[39:00]** Now it may well be that the mechanisms that work at one level are different at the other ones. So maybe grants here, prizes there, and taxes above that or vice versa, just different mechanisms for different purposes. Because as we've been discussing, there's no perfect solution. Every mechanism trades off against different other things in different ways and optimizes in different ways, and that's why they're hard to sort of figure out exactly what is the correct one to use. But the general philosophy here is it's the same problem just repeated at a higher level, itself similar.

**Chris Berg:**

**[39:33]** Scott, I mean, you're sort of the perfect person to talk to about this because Gitcoin has a mission to support the Ethereum ecosystem, not just to support the Gitcoin DAO, but how do you think about those externalities, your responsibility? And then how should any other DAO like PizzaDAO think about their responsibilities?

**Scott Moore:**

**[39:57]** So firstly, I think it's very interesting that we're talking about externalities because often people talk about public goods as non-ex-legal or non-rivalrous, and it's a very restrictive definition, I think relative to thinking in terms of what is the amount that the market is feeling this particular good and then what is the amount of positive externality that this good produces? And so the idea that something that's effectively a club can produce something that is a public good is kind of obvious in that framing, but it's less obvious in the context of the non-ex-legal, non-rivalrous framing, which I think we're very used to in a lot of traditional thinking like public goods.

**Scott Moore:**

**[40:42]** But in terms of our mission, we tend to think about the Ethereum ecosystem as the starting point, in some ways the starting point, for solving coordination problems in a global sense, and so although we're building things for Ethereum we hope that, in the same sort of nested sense, Ethereum is then solving problems on a global scale for other things. So I mean, a good example of this might be the work that folks like Toucan or KlimaDAO are doing with respect to climate change. So how do we solve the problem of people being unwilling to put money forward for things that are effectively good for the environment?

**Scott Moore:**

**[41:25]** Often the challenge is to get people to actually spend money, their own capital on things like carbon credits to push forward these solutions. So their solution is basically, let's create effectively a sort of like DeFi game in which you were basically like buying up these bonds, which happened to be tied into carbon credits and tied into carbon markets. And it works because precisely like this sort of like selfish DeFi economics, people are drawn to that sort of mentality and drawn to those sorts of games. And it happens to produce a positive outcome and positive externalities. And that's one example of where I think Ethereum is thereby creating positive externalities that would not otherwise exist in this sort of like broader world.

**Scott Moore:**

**[42:24]** Not that governments and companies aren't trying to solve this broader problem of climate change, but they generally be not doing a very good job. I don't know if you kind of look at the broader system we're in right now. Just look at it like the world, like there's clearly a lot to be done there. And I think, I'm not saying that, you know it's going to like.. save the entire world, that would be kind of absurd. But I think it's certainly a step in the right direction and it provides those tools in a way that is clearly benefiting more people than just Ethereum sort of like stakeholders. And I think that's exactly the kind of thing we're talking about when we're talking about these nested hierarchies of positive externalities.

**Chris Berg:**

**[43:11]** Is it necessary, Scott, then to have everybody who's participating in Gitcoin to sort of be signed up to the Gitcoin mission or message? The reason I ask, is because I think when we're thinking about this, the DAO ecosystem, will the individual contributors to the DAO might have loyalties to multiple DAOs at the same time? So you might hold Ethereum, you might also hold Bitcoin. You might also hold ZCash. You might also hold any number of particular DApps or DAOs or [inaudible] or all these sorts of things. Is there a role for Gitcoin, the organization, to sort of be teaching people about the sort of stuff that they want to see and to sign them up to the mission or are you just watching it evolve and see what the community decides?

**Scott Moore:**

**[44:04]** I definitely think we have a responsibility to get people to understand what public goods are and why they matter. If only because there's still a portion of people, even when you look at games like KlimaDAO, who won't participate, perhaps even like in some form, maybe even maliciously if they're like well I'd rather try and figure, like they have zero interest in the positive game that this could provide to a broader group. They're just like, okay I can choose between this return or this return, and they're going to choose something that maybe is a slightly higher return than KlimaDAO on a given day, and for some reason, the returns change. That sort of thing I think it can be at least one step, like trying to get people to understand the difference there and why it might make sense to try and still participate in a system that has slightly more positive externalities. 

**Scott Moore:**

**[45:04]** That understanding is, though incrementally better than not having it. And I think in terms of DAO participants especially, we mostly want people who are involved in the Gitcoin community to be there for the right reasons, i.e to understand the mission, understand why they're there. Partly because there is this problem across very large communities, in which there is a token involved, where you do get a lot of noise. And I think that for us, that noise is, I think generally detrimental to the mission at large. I think there are a lot of products that don't quite recognize that problem and are willing to kind of forego addressing it. And I think that is a long-run mistake because in many ways your community is only as strong as the sort of like weakest group. I mean that only in the sense that you need people to be driving all in the same direction and if you're getting pulled back by a given group, it can really be harmful.

**Scott Moore:**

**[46:19]** A good example of where this happened, perhaps not around public goods, but in terms of philosophy was with Sushi. So Sushi had the core team. They wanted to pursue a direction that would actually net help basically the Sushi community, in my opinion, push for its narrative and its goals. But because there was this noise in the background, it was very hard for them to actually execute on that and to make it happen. So part of that is just a lack of understanding and a lack of mission alignment that comes with that additional noise. In our case, educating people about public goods is just ultimately like, we think it's important for the community at large, for Ethereum at large, for web3 at large. But it's perhaps even more important for the Gitcoin community itself.

**Chris Berg:**

**[47:07]** In that sense Jason, there's almost a DAO cultural politics that has to be at the foundation of these before we can decide how we're going to spend this treasury? 

**Jason Potts:**

**[47:19]** Yeah, I mean, these are collective action problems. They're inherently political. That's a thing that if we didn't know that before, we're clearly learning that now. I think there are a few interesting differences there. Compared to Republican or Democratic politics, I mean that in the broader sense, not the American party sense, that the way DAO problems are solved is an issue by issue. You raise a proposal for this or we have a grant for this and then you make it into an individual issue. So it's a very entrepreneurial, market-driven solution that nevertheless has a collective action, funding mechanism wrapped around it. Sort of entrepreneurial proposing of a problem or a solution and then the funding model. 

**Jason Potts:**

**[48:04]** It is worth pausing to reflect, that's not how politics and nation-states work, where you have a ticket, where you have just a list of, these are all the things we're going to do with the money, with the collective money. And that's the sort of series of negotiations that you might be, I like that but not that, but whatever, but you have to vote for the whole ticket or the other one. So you end up with these sort of very politically negotiated issues that basically it's hard to be engaged about all of them because amongst that, there might be an issue that you care about, but you have to buy the whole package. I think, whether it's a different point with the way in which DAO politics are working, is that it's very much entrepreneurial, single-issue politics, which has enormous benefits, it can be fast, it can be focused, it can really get into things and solve those problems.

**Jason Potts:**

**[48:57]** But the one thing it doesn't do very well is deal with large, coordinated, joined-up things that you need. High-level sort of political visionary that can see, that there are actually 27 things that all need to happen. And each constituency will only care about some of them, but the whole thing needs to happen. I think this is a question that Chris and myself have been discussing, about whether sort of political parties or protocol politicians that's kind of the next step in DAO governance evolution, whether that would be an amazing thing to help move everything forward.

**Chris Berg:**

**[49:31]** Or exactly what we're trying to get away from.

**Jason Potts:**

**[49:34]** Terrible step backwards into the worst aspects of the 20th century. I genuinely don't know what the answer is.

**Chris Berg:**

**[49:41]** What I like about this conversation is that we started with how can you construct the technicalities of a grants program and organize the agreement? And we've ended up with sort of culture and voting. So I'm going to give the last question to you, Scott.

So how do we set that culture? So if culture and if the sign-up to the mission of the DAO is what's going to drive the grants programs and drive how we spend, what do we need to do? Do we need to have like the DAO version of corporate anthems? Do we need constitutions? Do we need flags? How can you convince the members of Gitcoin to sign up to the Gitcoin agenda or a story or mission?

**Scott Moore:**

**[50:28]** We clearly need just very flashy political ads. But I think that the issue right now is that if we look at culture across web3, I don't think we've actually done a very good job of articulating our values as an ecosystem, even beyond individual DAOs. And I actually suspect that that's one of the broader problems that we need to be solving before we can actually solve for this, more broadly and propagate this message out to the rest of the world.

**Scott Moore:**

**[51:09]** You're kind of seeing this with, even like not to get too far off track, but with the Meta conversations and with Facebook entering web3 or with projects like WorldCoin, for example, which I think probably take us somewhat in, what I would argue, just from a personal perspective, like the wrong direction. And I think they take us in the wrong direction without really, there are almost concentric circles. I think most people would agree that Facebook entering this space in this way is kind of disingenuous and perhaps not the direction you want to take.

**Scott Moore:**

**[51:45]** There's probably a smaller percentage of the people that would agree that any given arbitrary DeFi protocol, like not living up to x y z standard of decentralization. And it's not that we all have to agree on those things, but I think we need to definitely set some sort of values for the ecosystem, especially as the scope of what this ecosystem touches grows. And I think that's one of the mistakes that Web1 made, was not doing that. And which is how we ended up with the last vestige of the semantic web kind of being the Facebook, like in the Web2 era.

**Scott Moore:** 

**[52:18]** And I think, perhaps we can start by defining our own constitutions in the context of DAOs. It's something we've been doing internally in the DAO and Gitcoin. It's something that the ENS actually has explicitly done at its inception, requiring everyone to sign on to a set constitution, which I thought was an amazing idea. And that sort of thinking, if we can kind of combine and sort of triangulate all these different constitutions that DAOs come up with, I think we can get to a set of principles that will help us push this forward and help us all align on the idea, first and foremost, that public goods are good, that this is something that we should care about because there's still certainly a lot of folks in sort of the bitcoin arena, going back to 2012, 2013 that don't really think there's any world or role for public goods at all.

**Scott Moore:**

**[53:18]** Not to say that's true of everyone using that space. And I think that's one part of it is just getting alignment on things like that. But getting more nuanced alignment on what decentralization means, what kinds of protocols we think you know are or aren't in scope for what we want to see in the Ethereum ecosystem or what we want to give credibility to in the Ethereum ecosystem. This was just a big debate with FWB as well, in terms of the membership cost for being in the DAO, which I personally think, the folks running FWB are doing a really good job overall.

**Scott Moore:**

**[53:56]** But there's certainly a question of how exclusive versus inclusive do you want to be? And then, as we go further, there are more and more questions like that, that will naturally arise and having the skills to address them from these previous triangulations of these constitutions and previous discussions around these values will only

make that easier. And through that process, it almost becomes obvious, I think, what we should be spending our treasuries on. So it's kind of an abstract answer, maybe, but hopefully that helps.

**Chris Berg:**

**[54:32]** I'm an academic economist. I love abstract answers. Scott, that was awesome. Jason, a fantastic conversation. I'd like to thank you both for joining me. 

Thank you.
