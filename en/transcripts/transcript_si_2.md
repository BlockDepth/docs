**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[0:08]** Hello, and welcome to today's episode of this SCRF Interviews podcast. We're still in our first mini-series, exploring the intersection of culture and incentives, and I'm very excited for today's conversation where we're going to be digging a little more into culture and specifically, onboarding as well, and what the intersection of those two topics looks like.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[0:26]** To begin, I'll ask our guests to introduce themselves, and then we'll jump right into the conversation. So, Livia, do you mind kicking off the intros?

**Livia Deschermayer:**

**[0:32]** Yeah, thank you. Eugene. I’m Livia, so I'm part of The Commons Stack team where I go mostly for the cultural build where we've been implementing this process in the TEC, the Token Engineering Commons. And there, I lead the soft gov** **and culture of working group where we have been implementing the Ostrom Principles into our culture.

**Livia Deschermayer:**

**[01:00]** And I've been also in the research group of DAO reward systems with the Token Engineering Academy and Governance.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[1:12]** Thank you, Livia. Seth, do you mind jumping in?

**Seth Frey:**

**[1:14]** Hello, all, my name's Seth Frey. I'm a professor of communication at University of California, Davis. My training is cognitive science and computational social science, and where my career has taken me is after some experiences of really powerful self- governance, people coming together in the analogue space of cooperatives, such as housing cooperatives, I got more and more interested in the science of the Commons, the science of self-governance, the science of people building stuff together.

**Seth Frey:**

**[1:55]** Beyond lab experiments showing that cooperation exists, there's a lot about institutional structure for today, you know, culture norms, processes, and trust where people build surprisingly complex institutions for themselves to build meaning and build stuff and share resources together. And I study all that. I use a data science perspective, focusing on online communities, both because online is the place people are going to build meaning and because they're very amenable to data science and uniquely positioned to push the large-scale comparative institutional analysis, the large-scale study of successful self-governance to a new level. That's my connection to this all and to you all.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[2:45]** Perfect. Well, thank you both for joining, and I kinda want to start with a very high-level question, so feel free to take it in the direction that feels most comfortable. But I want to start off with the question of what role does culture play in communities in general, whether we're talking Web3 specific or more broadly?

**Livia Deschermayer:**

**[3:03]** I like to define culture as the tension between tradition and innovation, and I feel like both are so important, and having awareness of which elements compose the foundation of a community and what type of expanding movements are happening is really important for monitoring and addressing ecosystem health. So, just understanding where the community wants to move towards and what sets the foundation for the community, and maybe that is the role culture plays, having awareness of all the elements that play in a certain ecosystem.

**Seth Frey:**

**[3:44]** But for me, I'm approaching all of this from a lens of the work of Elinor Ostrom as the first woman who won the Nobel Prize in Economics for her work on the tragedy of the Commons and how communities sustainably manage common-pool** **resources.

**Seth Frey:**

**[4:00]** So when I'm looking at a community, I’m looking pretty much from the lens of what are their resources and sort of orienting my entire understanding of what they're up to and why they do what they do, around the fact that limited resources and the trust or the rules or the processes or enforcement or monitoring, that's necessary to ensure the kind of sustainable access and sharing and extraction of those resources and building of those resources.

**Seth Frey:** 

**[4:27]** So, for me, we're culture fit’s in is understanding the governance outcomes and resource management outcomes. You can make a distinction out of Ostrom’s world between rules and form, which is your formal structure and rules of use, which is going to be your kind of more general thing, including culture, which I define as all the stuff that predicts how the organization is going to turn out, that's internalized by the members.

**Seth Frey:**

**[5:00]** This could be internalized values, internalized mental models, internalized behaviours, all the stuff that doesn't necessarily need rules in order to be counted on because people are representing it inside themselves. And so the role that culture plays then is reducing how much you’re leaning on written rules. It's almost contextualizing rules. Some set of rules might only make sense or might only be effective in the context of a group of people who have internalized the values that they kind of, maybe you rely on and they depend on, internalize the prerequisites those rules need to be effective.

**Seth Frey:**

**[5:43]** And so, for me, culture plays a little bit of the role of the secret sauce. How do we articulate it, maybe more explicitly or pull out or name that context so that we know all the ingredients that lead to the institutional success beyond just the text I can scrape off of written rules.

**Livia Deschermayer:**

**[6:03]** I like the secret sauce.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[6:06]** And that makes me think a little bit about sort of, say, the chicken and the egg problem with humans and culture, sort of, do the humans bring—are they the ones setting a culture into an environment or is it at that intersection of the humans and the resources? Because I know prior to thinking about this more deeply, things like resources or asset mapping or community mapping, those things would seem very different than whatever this flowery thing that culture might be, that's hard to put a finger on. But it's so interesting that both of you kind of came in from the angle of the awareness of what's in the ecosystem or the specific resources.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[6:40]** Yeah, I guess when thinking or, you know, starting up a new community, how much is it there like, “Hey, I'm starting this, I'm inherently creating a culture,” or is culture fundamentally in the context of a constrained environment where there are limited resources and time?

**Seth Frey:**

**[6:54]** Well, for my view, because you touched very much on resource, so I'll take the lead. I think you get a lot for free from the context if…You get a lot of culture for free, if there's a group of people who really need the resources to exist, whose livelihoods really depend on it, or whose ideologies or values are really aligned with what the group is trying to accomplish, you just kind of get a lot of that for free. And if you're working for something where there's that self-motivation in place for the thing to succeed, then people go really far and you're already getting that internalized values kind of off the bat, which just goes a long way. 

**Seth Frey:**

**[7:39]** If you're more of a… I don’t know… If we’re talking the day job scenario, if we're talking like a minor thing governing like sharing of cat memes rather than your livelihood, then I could see A), people, maybe just being more satisfied with the rules and having a little less on culture. 

**Seth Frey:**

**[7:59]** And also, people who, to the extent that you want culture, maybe be having to take a more active role in building it and getting intentional about it from your organization’s leadership or from any kind of intentional community level understanding that we're going to have to work on this if we're going to have a large internalized component of how we work as a group.

**Livia Deschermayer:**

**[8:26]** Yeah, I think this question is especially interesting now and in the crypto space or the DAO space where it has been very intentional, like the coming together of those communities, and especially when people come from all sorts of backgrounds, and there is this intersection point where there is like a bubbling pot of so many ingredients that people bring with themselves already. 

But then there's this process of understanding what is the shared mission of that group? And I think if this process is brought in as an intentional collaborative process where people can understand together what they're doing there, what is their mission, what are their values, what are they agreeing on, then it creates a ground for another level of culture to be built based on what each individual brings. And, of course, they have their own culture. But having a shared path or a shared understanding of where you're going, brings this to a different level of like co-creating culture, not only from the things that you have inherently, but the things that you want to develop together.

**Seth Frey:**

**[9:46]** That’s really cool. One thing that's just been a great pleasure about meeting Commons Stack people in particular; Smart Contract Research Forum people in particular; has been that culture is a no brainer. I mean, that sounds obvious, right? Except that the whole ideology of the crypto space is we can have computational trust that we don't have to build a human person to person trust. We can have computational alignment, right? Mechanism-driven decentralized alignment that we don't need to have conversations to reach alignment.

**Seth Frey:**

**[10:21]** And that is an attitude, like a hope or a dream or a vision and that drives a lot of work and arguably a lot of innovation in the crypto space generally, which people who believe that should get as far as they can with that, and I want to see how far they get with that. But for me, it's really energizing, rather, to hear people who are using the power of crypto, maybe more pragmatically or selectively or narrowly or more complimentarily to complement all of this human side stuff. 

**Seth Frey:**

**[11:00]** And in that, let’s see… I mean a traditional approach to organization says like, we have all these processes that take a certain amount of work to maintain. We have all this soft, fluffy culture stuff that takes a certain amount of work, effort, and intentionality to maintain. When you move into a more DAO kind of direction, the organization stuff takes less to maintain; you’ve mechanized a lot of it and algorithymified a lot of it. But the cultural stuff is just as hard as it was the first day.

**Seth Frey:**

**[11:36]** Given that, I do see an opportunity in the DAO space, for maybe, precisely because your organizational side takes a little bit less effort to keep up. It almost gives us an opportunity to really hone in and bring attention to culture in a new way, because it's just so much more obviously that secret sauce, that thing that – we'll call it free capacity. If we can build within groups, the dimensions of internalization that are valuable, we have a bunch of capacity for free in terms of not having an institutional or formal structure and get more for everybody out of the group.

**Livia Deschermayer:**

**[12:19]** Absolutely. Yeah, I think if anything, the tech and the algorithms should just help people to be more connected to each other and to have more points of trust and to have more contact than to building those organisms that are not… Like, I think when we're talking about DAOs especially, or my vision, at least, is that it goes a little bit beyond organizations, then it gets this organic organism form of the… It's like a membrane for you to get in and people join and people move in and out in a more fluid type of movement rather than, I don't know, more structured processes that usually exist in traditional organizations. 

**Livia Deschermayer**:

**[13:10]** And I think to your point of... Well, we have all of these tools, and we're focusing so much on them. I think even for algorithmic policies, for example, or algorithmic-aided governance, still, the data being captured by those tools is data that comes from people, that comes from behaviour, that comes from the relationships that are happening in the space. And if there is not a clear feedback loop of like, okay, this data is getting into the system, then we have a simulation, then we have these algorithms that will give directions for how people should behave or for how decisions should be made.

**Livia Deschermayer**:

**[14:00]** And if this circle is not happening in a way that advances the purpose of the organization, then it needs to be reassessed, so  the look into the culture and into the people always needs to be happening, no matter how many tools we have to assist that process.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[14:24]** Yeah, and I would be interested in getting both of your perspective on the question of, sort of, the link between commitment to culture and the health of that culture. And in the crypto space, I'm thinking of the rage quit model and the fact that like, once you just get frustrated, it's like, “Nah, I've had enough of this, let me just go elsewhere and hang out.” And how does that change it? And, Seth, to think of some of the work that you've done with Nathan Schneider, if I'm remembering correctly, around effective voice and exit, just kind of taking those two perspectives just from your different worlds around.

Yeah. What tensions arise if I know it's easier or harder for me to leave an environment, does that actually help? Do elements of that consistently help culture or hurt it in some kind of way?

**Seth Frey:**

**[15:08]** So, in addition to my theory work, we have an exit invoice, a paper, me and Nathan Schneider. There is some data work with my student, Qiankun Zhong, and the two of us looked at Minecraft. So, Minecraft has a property of a lot of online organizations that you can just leave. There is thousands of community-run servers out there, and if you don't like one of them, you can go to another. And we had 50 million entry and exit events from 10 million people over a couple of hundred thousand servers. We were able to drill down and ask, “Okay, you just had this trajectory through all these servers, and they had all these different governance styles, which we're able to scrape by scraping the governance plug-ins that these servers had installed. Did you install social hierarchy, private property rights? Did you install punishment? Did you prevent bad behaviour? Or install tools to help you manage it; roll it back afterwards, you know, vandalism** **and such?

**Seth Frey:**

**[16:09]** And so then the question is… We're treating culture a lot as both an output, the thing that got built as a result of effort and an input, a thing that led to increased organizational effectiveness. And so let's try to piece those apart. What was stronger? What was a bigger effect on a community's level of success, say? Was it that people saw this culture in place, this governance system in place and selected into it? Or what was it that, you know, hundreds of people were in a community, but the only ones who stayed, who didn't rage quit were the ones who were most in line with how it was.

**Seth Frey:**

**[16:50]** So, what's the bigger effect? Is it the governance system on who selects into it? Or is the people who select into a community, eventually changing and morphing a governance system to match their own values and alignment? We're able to show, it looks like an order of magnitude, stronger effect on – the first one: that the governance system seems to have a stronger effect on the people than the people self-selecting in.

**Seth Frey:**

**[17:23]** Now, that’s just one study. It's one very specific domain, right? Minecraft is not all online organizations, but A) it illustrates a little bit of the power of data science to advance these questions in a way that meets space. Organizations just always had to kind of take it on faith or go by their gut, and it reflects a little bit the power of your governance system and the uniqueness of online communities, that exit is such an option, it ends up being an additional tool in the toolkit for people who are building meaning collectively in the online context.

**Livia Deschermayer:**

**[18:04]** Yeah, that is super interesting, especially having… You probably don't have so much the identity of the players, right?

**Seth Frey:**

**[18:14]** We have a UID that we know it was the same person who went from here to there to there. But right, we know nothing about the actual human being behind it. Is it some very proficient 13-year-old? Is it a group of dads? We don't really have this story. Overall demographics and our median age of Minecraft is probably 20-ish now.

But beyond that, you're right, it's a mystery. All we see are these trends.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[18:42]** So, Livia I was just wondering in terms of with that intersection of trying to think about commitment to culture and the health of it from what you've actually been seeing in different DAO’s, whether it's TEC-related activities or just out in the wild, so to say. But are there the elements where… I know MolochDAO is probably an example, where rage quitting helped to build a very specific culture and created a very specific environment versus other areas, and as Seth was kind of alluding to, are environments where it's like, “Well, we're the only ones left, so we clearly care about this kind of distilled culture.” Yeah, just kind of what else have you been seeing from just the examples of different DAO’s  and how that intersection plays out?

**Livia Deschermayer:**

**[19:24]** Yeah, I think off-boarding is so important as onboarding, right? Like, that people need to understand that they won't be harmed with the exit also. I think sometimes there is a lack of care when someone is leaving the process rather than when someone is entering. And in the TEC, we developed this offboarding ceremony for the stewards. That is just to acknowledge all the work they've done. And we give them an NFT of like, “awesome participation,” and just like have a session that everyone can share whatever they want to them, that other stewards can appreciate that work.

**Livia Deschermayer:**

**[20:12]** And we had a session in soft governance to kind of bring this concept of death and how we usually have a very hard time talking about death. And how to… that is such a human aspect, and it’s such a part of our culture, too. So do we experienced some type of the grief feelings, (grieving feelings, is that how you say it?) or, I don't know, what are the emotions related to the exit of someone in the community. So that has been an interesting path we’ve been taking there.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[20:54]** It's really interesting to think of kind of specific actions and rituals that can help imbed culture. And I guess, is there, from either perspective just in terms of working with DAO’s or from your research perspective or any other angle, have you seen any kind of particular…I already imagine the answer is going to be “it depends”. But are there any kind of specific kind of rituals that correlate to culture building or is it all just depend on the nature of the culture that you're building, which I feel like it's a bit of a...

**Seth Frey:**

**[21:25]** Oh yeah, so welcome to my** **research, it depends.

But I might be able to say something general, not exactly from the research, this is probably just more from my being a person in the world associated with organizations, but there is like a toolkit, right? There are exercises you can do in organizational building. You can have really intentional onboarding. You can have a lot of circle ops, you can just be intentional about talking about it a lot.

**Seth Frey:**

**[22:01]** It’s sort of a metacultural thing of talking about culture. Yeah, offboarding is really cool, ritual is really great and has deep roots in a lot of human interaction. We can imagine there’s culture space, which is the space of all possible cultures, and the more tools you’re using, the more of those space is available to you. So, if you’re just leaning one tool, let’s say exit, you know, take it or leave it.

**Seth Frey:**

**[22:26]** If you don’t like it, you just go somewhere else, you won’t get hurt. There’s a lot of other options, but I’d probably argue that you’re restricted to a pretty small part/subset of culture space. But then the more you add, let’s say other things, more intentional practices, the more you invest just day to day resources  in caring where people are at, the more of the potential space of possible cultures opens up to you, possibly even loaded things like healthy culture or stronger culture.

**Livia Deschermayer:**

**[23:01]** And I think also there is a natural movement, that when something ends, there is space for something else to emerge. And just keeping track of those movements on how rituals are probably wanting to maintain some sort of practice, or they are grounding people in an experience, they're providing a sense of belonging.

**Livia Deschermayer:**

**[23:29]** But then what is the opposite of that? What is that rituals block somehow? Maybe there is some openness, or there is something that wants to disrupt a certain pattern that might not be healthy, that needs to come from another angle. And then whenever there is a ritual for something that is ending, what is the space that is being opened for something innovative to come in? Or maybe for another type of practice or for another type of questioning, or for other people to bring other perspectives as well?

**Seth Frey**

**[24:09]** So, Livia, can I ask a little bit? So I have a sense of my knowledge about this kind of thing comes from right? There's structured observation and data and all these analyses. And then, you know, I have done activism in organizing. But, to be honest, think most of my knowledge from that route, from experience in the practitioner’s side of how to build strong and healthy cultures comes more from, “Oh wow, I messed that one up; that's a lesson learned.” I wouldn’t say that I've been doing it for quite long enough or quite with enough of a knack that my experience… to have seen just the knowledge I have from experience leading to great outcomes. And so, yeah, I'd love to hear, since this is your job, where are your sense of your knowledge comes from about the effectiveness of culture building?

**Livia Deschermayer:**

**[25:01]** Well, I've been an actress for most of my life, since I was eleven, and I think that gave me first, tools to learn about myself, as like my body is my work tool. And I think also as a having like collectives trying to build something together.

So, my background is mostly in theatre and then performance art and cinema also. But the theatre, I think, is the bulk of this art of coming together and creating something. And there is a lot of conflict, but you need to manage that somehow. And then sometimes there's structures where there is a very clear hierarchy with a directory that has all the power. Sometimes it's a more collaborative process where people are just coming with their own creations, and that needs to be merged into a final piece somehow.

**Livia Deschermayer:**

**[26:05] **And I think both the structures have different burdens and benefits; and I particularly appreciate more of the less hierarchical structure because I think it's more creative, the solutions that come up when people need to figure something out and just having that space for allowing individual creativity. So, I try to bring a lot of this into the spaces I'm in now because I think there's a lot of similarities, but I'm definitely learning so much day by day with all of the things that don't go so right or yeah, that we need to improvise.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[26:47]** And in general, in the long run, I wonder how many of these learnings can be naturally deduced without the failure cases and how much do we need for everything to go horribly wrong for us to understand, “Right, so we know what we don't do now,” and then start building something new that hopefully is a little a little better. Have either one of you seen examples where it is more natural deduction, where it’s like, “We can come up with a culture best practice,” without ever seeing the failure case? I feel like that's a much more challenging one. Unless you somehow have data on every culture ever, which I don't think exists yet.

**Seth Frey:**

**[27:22]** In my view, the closest you can get to that... Yeah, I love science. I think it's the best way to build knowledge systematically, but it's only as good as the thing you're studying. Like, it is only as useful as much as the thing you're studying is amenable to that approach.

**Seth Frey:**

**[27:45]** And so I'm a little wary of general prescriptions or practices or what happened over there informing what we should do today. When it comes to culture building in particular it’s a really great domain. The best we can do in terms of learning and learning with a minimum of mistakes, I think is learning with lots of small mistakes in daily practice. So having like fast, small, tiny, constant iteration or reflection in your own organization and its daily practices with a lot of feeling of the room and a lot of what you might call emotional intelligence is going to be the way to kind of systematically build something that makes sense for your organization, your culture without really costly mistakes.

**Seth Frey:**

**[28:44]** I do have some intuition about that coming properly from data, we've got some preliminary work going on. Very exciting! We just put people in all experimental laboratory virtual world and there are four rules that… It's a cooperation game, so you can fail at the game, or you can succeed at the game, and everyone makes more money. If you trust each other a little bit, put in the work, everyone else does as well, and everyone just gets more out than if you're a straight up selfish. To encourage cooperative outcomes, because a baseline with no rules, it's a lot of failure, to encourage cooperative outcomes, we created four rules and they're all kind of orthogonal to each other. So what we're able to do is put hundreds of people in all 16 combinations of those four rules. So you people have no rules; you people will have rules one and three; you people are going to have rules one, two and four.

**Seth Frey:**

**[29:41]** And this isn't culture, this is written rules. But for written rules, the effectiveness, how good rule one is in improving outcomes, depends so much on the other rules. So, incrementalism in terms of any kind of general insight of how these should combine is completely out the window, and a lot of building effective outcomes becomes empirical for our current context, for the rules we inherited and the context we inherited, general insights about whether this rule works and then my kind of help. But the best way to really know is just to do it and see what happened and then try again and try again and try again, slowly building something. Because you have so many unexpected interactions between rules in the outcomes for a specific context, if we're in a domain where context is king, where the effectiveness of some intervention just 100% depends on where you're trying to implement it, then it becomes a case where culture building is like empirical, personal, contextualized first.

**Seth Frey:**

**[30:53]** And there’s good news and bad news there. The bad news is systematic, general, broad, observation and like, maybe you’re not going to get like a list of rules; maybe you’ll just kind of list the best practices, which are like suggestions that you should be expected to defy. The good news is there is a process you can go through. You can evolve on your own and that means, you’re the expert. Yeah, the good news is, you’re the expert, you’re the person in the world with the most expertise for building your organization the way you want to be and for aligning the people in your organization, the way they ought to be.

**Livia Deschermayer**:

**[31:35]** I’m curious, in that experiment, was that a point of observation; if the fact that people understood a lot of the rules or understood why those rules affected the way they were complying to them or the way they were participating in the game. Or there was no curiosity from participants and just general acceptance of the rules.

**Seth Frey:**

**[32:12]** We don't get access to curiosity or not, but people did experience all the rules for a bit of time. So, you get to play the game several times before you kind of get a sense of it. And that is really important what their experience of was the rule, which in turn depends like, wait, was this rule implemented at like a lull of cooperation in this little mini society? Or was this rule implemented at a high point of cooperation in this mini society?

**Seth Frey:**

**[32:43]** How effective the rule is depending on where you started. There's all this sensitivity to initial conditions. It's just kind of a mess. But if we're in it to the extent we're in domain where everything affects everything, the complexity of the scientific model is just going to be too high for that to be the place that you learn from. And we're going to be a domain that really respects direct experience, messing around and direct or, you know, someone like you (Livia) who's just been doing it for a long time, rather than someone like me building systems from the outside.

**Seth Frey:**

**[33:15]** Now, I think there are dimensions, there are questions in this where, yeah, everything makes everything, but some things affect everything more than others. And in those domains, it's going to be maybe where I'm a little bit less useless, right? Where it makes sense to bring me in, which is some kind of general framework or general claims or outcomes or findings. It could be a good starting point to someone who wants to be intentional about building a strong culture in their organization.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[33:42]** And I guess when thinking about the question of building culture, but specifically taking it from more of the onboarding angle as opposed to building a new organization angle, right? Because there's an entity that exists, it already has some kind of culture.

I know that, and I wonder Livia, if this resonates with your general Web3 experiences as well. But I feel like unfortunately, more times than not, you discover something exists. Then around that already is some error or vagueness of some culture. You know, you get whispers of a culture in the air, then you actually go, try to interact with things and you're like, “Hold on, I have to spend 40 hours to catch up to what's going on here. I don't have that. I have a full-time job. I have hobbies like, how am I supposed to do that?” 

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[34:23]** And now on the flip side, at SCRF, we’re intentionally thinking of how do we set the tone of our culture and how do we embed that as early as possible in the onboarding process? I wonder for both of you, at what point in the onboarding journey is it the right time to start taking the cultural angle? Or is that a fundamentally wrong question, because no matter how you structure your onboarding, it’s already telling whoever is going through it something about your culture.

**Livia Deschermayer:**

**[34:55]** Yeah, I think onboarding is some type of curation process, right? You have so much information and most of these communities have transparency as a value. So, there is a lot as soon as you enter and the space move so fast that you need some type of guidance from someone that is already immersed in that universe to tell you, like if you start here, you’re going to find your way and I’ll take you by the hand through the steps so you can feel welcome and that you belong and then slowly build that agency that I think is the most important part of like  being in a self-governing community. And I think the culture needs to be introduced very early and just the way that people interact with you is already part of that. Like If they're welcoming, that's probably part of their values, if you feel belonging, if you feel like you have access to things that you're interested in, if people are interested about you, like, how do you want to be treated, what are you interested in.? And I think especially the mission, vision and values need to be shared from the beginning because the person enters and understands where they're going and if they don't like where that's going, they should know as soon as possible. And if they like where that's going, they should know how to get aligned with that as soon as possible as well.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[36:33]** And I guess on that side, how much of it has been in terms of that needs to come through human-to-human interaction, of the only way I'm going to get that message across is if I get into a meeting with you and you tell me that as me being the new person to an ecosystem; or is that truly a multimodal message that you could send? Are there documentation or videos or whatnot or whatever that can actually help reinforce culture and not just provide process clarity?

**Livia Deschermayer:**

**[37:02]** Yeah, sure, I think we've been using a lot of Discord. And it's great to build bots and you can design experiences in many types of ways, and I think that's why a lot of DAO communities have been loving using Discord. But I think there's also a level of human-to-human interaction, that it's very important, just for people to feel... It's hard to feel welcome with a bot; and it's hard to feel like you belong if you don't have no one to talk to. And it's also not fun, I think. And I think fun, it's an important part of joining a community. You want some type of joy from being around people. And yeah, at least in the TEC, we've been experiencing the vibes of the community as being one of the main reasons why people join and stick around.

**Seth Frey:**

**[38: 03]** Maybe it's valuable to get a couple of obvious things or more kind of clear cut of things out of the way before getting into the meat. You can't have onboarding in the culture until there’s culture, so culture is like a very bottom-up process, that for a leader is really more observational than directed. In many cases, it ideally is something that happened to the leadership or the organization, rather than something it built in any kind of goal directed way.

**Seth Frey:**

**[38:34]** So, it's obviously going to only be after that, it’s meaningful to incorporate culture into onboarding. The need for culture in onboarding - I think there's evidence for both these things I'm going to say, certainly the first, the need for a lower if you're a low turnover organization and if you're ending with the same people you started with, then, well, there’s literally no onboarding. Actually, to the extent you have a very open fluid membership, but it probably becomes more important… And to the extent that, if you have a real smooth on ramp into the community where, “Oh, well, I worked for three years before joining up,” then there's less need for onboarding. So those kinds of more clear-cut things that probably transfer. They’re probably generally more or less true. For me, the question of onboarding is really interesting. It highlights a kind of open question in my head, I think I know the answer, but I don't like that answer. The possibilities are that… Okay, so there's a lot of bad cultures out there and there's a lot of unintentional cultures.

So, there is going to be two reasons for that. Either culture building is really complex, is really suited to people who have a certain vibe, sense that they have this special capability that they are born with or maybe they acquire through lots of mistakes.

**Seth Frey:**

**[40:00]** And it's a specialization you have to learn because it's complicated. The other possibility is it’s rare. Good healthy cultures are rare because culture brings a lot of work. It's super obvious; you just have to put in the work and do the stuff and then it will happen.

Onboarding, to me, it seems… I actually don't know what's the good news and what’s the bad news. If one of those is true, my gut is telling me - and what I'm learning as I talk to culture builders through interviews and informally and obviously through making my mistakes is, I think it's just a lot of work. The good news being that an organization just has to be intentional about fostering and encouraging it by hiring people like Livia. I don't know, what do you think, Livia?

**Livia Deschermayer:**

**[40:55]** Well, I think - you just said that it's very obvious, like, that culture is very obvious. I don't think it is. I think that is the main problem of… we are coming from such a wounded society that a lot of things that should be very basic for how we interact with one another seem not to be; and I think people have, including myself, many walls sometimes to interact with others or to feel vulnerable and to build meaningful connections that those connections will produce the value for what an economy might be about, and that culture is the base for any type of economic construction as well.

**Livia Deschermayer:**

**[41:55]** For any type of a value creation, you need to have some type of intentionality. And I think the more this is being brought up and more practices are being built and then people experience something here, something there, and they feel like, “Oh, this is possible, this is making me feel good. This is giving me insights. This is bringing points of reflections.” Like you mentioned earlier to have these quick iterations of like, what are some small mistakes and how can we reflect on those and what is a way of improving? Like, how many families have that? How many people had that and their own construction as human beings of like, “Oh, what happened? How can I reflect on that? How can I improve? How can I include others? How can I be more accepting and generous?” and all of these things. So, I think hopefully we're working towards making that more obvious.

**Seth Frey**

**[43:00]** That means a lot, actually. I mean, I realize there is a third option, which is the answer is both. Culture is complicated so, you need people with special training, with special skill sets if you want it to happen in your organization in a healthy, exciting, complimentary way to your rules. And it takes a lot of work, which means that the people with those special skill sets need a lot of your organization's resources and latitude in order to succeed at executing their skill set and have it actually amount to something. I guess, I think that’s the worst case scenario, in terms of A) systematic accumulation of knowledge and B) actually making it work.

**Livia Deschermayer:**

**[43:44]** Also, you mentioned now like, accumulating this systemic knowledge and from a point you were bringing about the Minecraft example too of like, having so many people in these digital spaces and having anons or people that have public identities or all mixed together and having the data perspective like, being able to gather so many data about the systems, gives this… It's like a combination of transparency with privacy, because you can see everything that's happening. You don't necessarily have people to point towards one thing or the other that happened either for better or for good.

**Livia Deschermayer:**

**[44:42]** But you have the perspective of how the system is moving according with the things that happen. So, it seems like now regaining the superpower to be able to touch on just the parts of the system that need to be improved, based on these loops that we're seeing and then change things from a systemic level and not from a personal level. So, yeah, it feels like it comes out of this, like taking things personal from a blame type of perspective, like a punishment-driven society to a more wholesome and change - like, being able to make changes in systemic levels.

**Seth Frey:**

**[45:31]** This is cool. You seem really in touch with the ways the technology in the online context are helping you on the culture-building front. I really want to hear more about that. And along the way, I'd really like to hear other aspects of your experience. I mean, it sounds like you developed a lot of your skills in the offline realm and in the process of transferring to domain where there is anonymity and there's really like a much broader spectrum of levels of engagement.

**Seth Frey:**

**[46:03]** There's the asynchronous nature of a lot of the communication. Could I kind of get your sense of how your kind of tool kit has adapted; there are some tools used more than you thought or that you've even had to introduce other tools that you kind of just don't use very much at all in adapting old skills to this domain?

**Livia Deschermayer:**

**[46:23]** I mean, there's one tool that I feel very bummed to not be using so much, which is the body. I feel like that gives so much perspective into everything. Like, see how people behave in conferences. I always wanted to have like a drone view of how everyone is so excited to be around each other because there's all this intimacy that is built with all of these other tools that we've been using. 

**Livia Deschermayer:**

**[46:57]** And maybe there's something interesting about relationships starting and in a certain distance because I think there's an incentive for honesty, and especially with people being able to be anons, you can share what you're thinking and you can, I don't know, take tasks to work on and just be in places and you're somehow protected. And then this can build the trust level little by little. And then eventually you are like, “Ah, opening my video today” or “I am showing up at that conference and saying that I am who I am,” or… I don’t know… I have seen some of those happening. And it's always like beautiful moments that you feel like people brighten up a little bit. So, I hope at some point the body will come more into the game because there's so many other parts of us that as we're building this wholesome systems, will need to be brought in fully as our full expression. Even, I don't know, even talking about sexuality in a very safe space, even talking about like what are other things that people were doing in their lives that are intersectional to the technology and having creative spaces, having residences.

**Livia Deschermayer:**

**[48:34]** I think more and more this will start happening, like bringing artists and developers together and seeing what are all the amazing things that can be created.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[48:47]** And mentioning kind of tools and earlier mentioning Discord bots, just because now, in my mind, Discord bots in Web3 communities are a layer of bureaucracy, limiting your ability to just go hound their community without needing to go through some basic checks. But it's an important one; and we're thinking of a Discord bot that was not meant to be a critical statement towards the bots, but it just makes me wonder when that's no longer just a pure tech space, fully automated thing that feels very impersonal.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[49:14]** But when it's someone popping up in a full AR high-quality 1080P definition right in front of you. And what is the nature of the true humanity that must always be present there and the other elements that we've been missing out because our tech does not have a good way to bring the kinaesthetic to a digital interaction yet? And there's no ways to do that. I am still unclear of if I am more excited or more scared of how technology is going to change this. Is it really going to just make us, you know, if we had the chance to be sitting in a single recording studio now, like, yes, you could feel the body language, you could feel the energy, there’s just different things you could read off people, and is just being able to replicate that digitally enough to enhance something?

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[50:00]** Or is there always just something that our brain just fiends for that is fundamentally human, that is part of this complexity and figuring out, you know, given the mission and the kind of people you're bringing together and everything else, you just have to find that secret sauce that will never be predefined for your community? It's always going to be at that intersection of the specific goal, of the specific people and of the specific tools and environments that you find yourself in. I don't know if that was a question or just asking you to comment on my ramble, but whatever you feel comfortable with there.

**Seth Frey:**

**[50:32]** That’s the worst-case scenario, and I think it's useful to go in assuming that, and if you end up finding lessons that transfer from another organization, you have bonus points. If you end up finding like a magically talented person who's just made for it, you know, bonus points. But maybe it's the situation of assuming the worst, assuming you're in an “everything affects everything” kind of context with culture building and allow yourself to be the expert, allow yourself to tinker, and just have a rule one being intentional about it and reflective… That one rule. That’s the one rule.

**Livia Deschermayer**:

**[51:13]** Seth, it sounds like you came from a non-tech environment first, if I'm correct?

**Seth Frey:**

**[51:25]** Yes, physical housing cooperatives.

**Livia Deschermayer**:

**[51:28]** And you move then to the DAO space or having more access to Web3 in this transition; so, you've seen kind of like both worlds, and both of them having this approach on culture? What do you think the DAO space is missing the most from this very grounded knowledge from cooperatives now? And what is your experience of bringing this forth? Like, how did you see this transition?

**Seth Frey:**

**[52:03]** I moved online, not because I care about internet users necessarily or the internet necessarily, really, I first moved to it because it’s where all the data was at. It was the way to go. You know, we're coming from a time where the work of Ostrom, our best-known results from her are the design principles for common sustainable resource management. And that was like ten years of work probably or more meta-analysis of 300 ethnographies that themselves took years and decades to write. And through that huge comparative effort, she was able to still have these sorts of very common principles across successful resource  management institutions.

**Seth Frey:**

**[52:48]** I went online because in six months I can get 300, I can get 3,000, I can get 300,000. And so it's just about scaling up the data is absolutely the pre-req to improving the quality of the general insights. Of course, once I get online, I see whoa, wow, this really means something to people. People are becoming better people online. So, it does it start to become something meaningful about looking at internet for internet sake more than is just a data source.

**Seth Frey:**

**[53:20]** Now what that means for DAO’s and what DAO’s are missing; I can go two directions: I can either pretend or not pretend like I know what I'm talking about. There's a lot to be said for pretending you know what you're talking about, but I think my first orientation and my hat in this conversation is more on the first side. I made it clear I'm still surprised and impressed that anyone in crypto space cares about this stuff, and I'm only still putting together my mental model to appreciate that if within crypto people, you're a DAO person, if you self-selected into this subspace of that larger space, then you've already got certain kind of values, commitments, ideology in place. And it still feels just so young and so early in the possibilities is so bafflingly large that I'm definitely much more in a position to learn from what's going on here than to really be able to tell you all anything.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[54:30]** And unfortunately, I realize our time is slowly going to be coming to an end here, but I wanted to transition from that note to kind of flipping - and for both of you, whether it's Livia in the context of Web3 or Seth, more broadly in the context of communities, whether offline or online; and I guess really, the broader context can be for both of you because it comes back down to just such a fundamentally human coordination element to it. But what are you excited to see more experimentation towards or what kind of outcomes do you want to see people trying to shoot for when they are thinking about culture?

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[55:07]** If you're actually talking to someone, whether it's a researcher or someone whose job it is to build or be responsible for overseeing, building, whatever you want to call it, culture at an organization, what are the kind of things you hope those folks are saying and keeping top of mind as they do their explorations or their building?

**Seth Frey:**

**[55:23]** For my part, I’ve really emphasized how a lot of this work in your DAO, whoever you are, is going to be, worst case, you on your own building it without a lot of general insights and it's going to be a personal process.

**Seth Frey:**

**[55:37]** They can't benefit from systematic observation by a scientist. But if that's ever going to be possible, there is a fair chance it's going to be possible in DAO space. If there's a standardized technical back end, if a lot of DAOs are showing up basically with the same API in some sense at some level, and their structure is putting the importance of the culture in relief because it's so much traditional effort that got put into maintaining organizational process has been automated, then you’ve got DAOs as a perfect laboratory for the kind of systematic observation that science is capable of, and it becomes the kind of thing that's suddenly amenable to the ideal perfect form, the least bad possible form of knowledge building, which is the scientific approaches. So, my most exciting thing - you can tell I'm a scientist— is DAOs as a laboratory for gaining insights into culture building in general that have never been possible through systematic observation in any other kind of human social system. That's my dream.

**Livia Deschermayer:**

**[56:48]** I think what I would like to see happening more or more awareness coming into is just the health of individuals, just how people have been showing up to these organizations, to these groups and if we're thinking about systemic changes, really looking into the effects that the systems that we are transitioning out of, the systems that we are exiting from have left in us. So, what are some of the behaviours that are still harmful that we are carrying within our mental models, within our behaviours, within our health practices; and how this self-observation and the insights that all data-driven processes bring to us like defining metrics for health, understanding, like what are all of the places where you can get better data from yourself? What is the awareness you have into the decisions you've been making?

**Livia Deschermayer:**

**[58:08]** What are the decisions you can make in your everyday environment and how they affect the way you interact with other people, how they affect your awareness of class of social belonging in general, and bringing these questionings to a fresh start to those new systems of like, how can we care more about the way we show up to each other and less about this very output-oriented like massive production capitalist run that has been prevasing our lives for so long?

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[58:49]** Yeah, I really love the hopeful note to end us on there, I know for myself that it always comes back down to these are just but tools of exploration for the fundamental human questions. The tools themselves are frequently not the exciting part in the grand scheme of things.

But yeah, I appreciate both of you taking the time to join and we will make sure to include any links on your work and the organizations you're affiliated with in the show notes. And we're just tremendously appreciative of you taking the time.

So, thank you both.

**Livia Deschermayer:**

**[59:20]** Thanks, Eugene. 

**Seth Frey:**

**[59:21] **Thanks, Eugene.
