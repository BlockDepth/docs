**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[00:14]** Hello, and welcome to today's episode of SCRF interviews. This is actually the first in our second mini-series where we're going to be exploring questions around treasury management and funding public goods. And this mini-series is produced in collaboration with RMIT, and I'm very excited to have Chris and Darcy from RMIT and Bull Trapper, Bull from the Yearn [Finance] community to get to actually dive into some of these questions today so we can explore that. So, first things first, let's go around and do some quick intros. So, I'll hand it off to you, Chris, as the other host.

**Chris Berg:**

**[00:48]** Awesome. Thanks Eugene. I'm really excited to have this conversation today, because it's such an important topic and such an important series. My name is Chris Berg, as Eugene has mentioned. I'm a co-founder of the RMIT Blockchain Innovation Hub, which is a business school research center into blockchain technology, we were established in 2017; and my area, I'm a crypto economist so I look at a lot of blockchain governance things like treasury management with Darcy who'll introduce himself in a moment. Lots of crypto economic design, tokenomics and really all the stuff that you could get an economist to do in this incredible space.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[01:25]** Great. Thank you. Bull, do you mind jumping in next?

**Bull Trapper:**

**[01:27]** Sure. I'm Bull. I'm a contributor at Yearn Finance. It's a yield aggregator on the Ethereum blockchain. I've been working with Yearn since near the beginning. I come from the traditional finance realm, but I'm a crypto native and been in the space for quite some time. So, most of my responsibilities and work I do with Yearn relate to budget, treasury management, farming of assets, and making sure there's sufficient runway and financial health of the organization.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[01:59]** Great. Thank you, Bull. Darcy, you mind jumping in?

**Darcy Allen:** 

**[02:02]** Fantastic. My name is Darcy Allen. I am an economist, a senior research fellow at the RMIT Blockchain Innovation Hub. I'm an economist working on blockchains. Got into this space around 2015, 2016; very interested in the governance of blockchains and all of that involves, and a big part of that at the moment, as perhaps we approach some kind of crypto winter is treasury management, how are we going to get through that, and also how do you do that in the context of a DAO? We're doing this in a very open ecosystem, so excited to be here, excited to have a chat. Thanks for having me.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[2:35]** Of course. Yeah. Thank you all for joining. And so, to kick off the conversation for today, I kind of want to start with the very high level question of, well, why is treasury hard in the first place? What is it about it that fundamentally makes it so complicated?

**Bull Trapper:**

**[02:51]** I can talk about that. In terms of in crypto projects, treasury is difficult because one, a lot of the crypto application projects, they're not making much money, actually. They're not getting much cashflow from earnings, and so it's hard because if you're not making money, then how do you build your treasury. Then two there's an inherent volatility that's not in typical normal companies, but they are in crypto because you know, the assets are very volatile. So, it makes it challenging to balance the volatility of the markets and be adequately hedged, no matter what happens with the markets. And on top of that, because Yearn is a DAO and a lot of the projects and things in crypto are DAO’s, it's a little bit challenging because there's no CFO, there's no "CFO," it's a decentralized community of contributors. So, sometimes it's slower to get consensus. You know, there's not one person writing checks, so that makes things slightly more difficult than a normal organization for treasury.

**Darcy Allen:**

**[03:55]** I completely agree with all of that. So, what we have here, when we're talking about treasuries, we're talking about really a pool of collectively owned digital assets, typically earmarked for funding some kind of local public goods within an ecosystem. The problem is we don't know what local public goods we need, and we also want to protect the treasury at the same time. And we try and create governance structures that attempt to overcome those dual problems at the same time. Now, this is a really hard problem for a number of reasons that are quite unique to blockchain. We have an open ecosystem, right? So, early decisions about a treasury might be made by particular stakeholders, early founders and so on, but over time as an ecosystem grows, there's a lot more stakeholders, and also the incentives of those stakeholders change and they might not necessarily be aligned.

**Darcy Allen:**

**[04:56]** So, we’re trying to figure out who owns the treasury, they’re trying to make decisions about what to do with the treasury under extreme uncertainty. That’s a really hard problem, and it creates some really interesting dynamics that this tends to happen in public. It’s really quite fascinating reading these forums about treasury diversification and treasury management, and all of the different perspective that are coming in there from the ecosystem itself. So, there’s a lot of things that make it complicated; the things that make blockchain governance itself quite complicated and hard, but very, very important.

**Chris Berg:**

**[05:33]** Bull, I might throw to you. It strikes me looking at some of these debates about how we should use treasuries, how we should manage treasuries, that there's not really uniform agreement on what a treasury is actually there for. Is it there to fund public goods? Is it there to fund public goods that the ecosystem might care about or crypto in general might care about? Or should we be using it to fund ongoing operations? Or should we just build up a war chest? Is that a fair description that even before we get to how we going to spend it, it's not totally clear that there's consensus over what it is there for in the first place?

**Bull Trapper:** 

**[06:13]** You know, working on behalf of treasury, you're a steward to governance and you're steward to the governance token holders, but at the same time, it's an operation: you know, there's earnings, there's expenses; so Yearn in particular has created an innovative model where there's certain teams, they are yTeams they call them which Yearn contributor track has developed that we implement, and these smaller teams operate as stewards on behalf of governance and token holders, and they can be changed out by votes by token holders. So in particular, there's a budget team that, you know, manages the treasury and they do things that need to be done in order to keep operations going and also to fund growth for new developers, new projects, new initiatives and then also, you know, returning or acting on behalf of governance holders. So, one of our Yearn improvement proposals was that earnings are going to be used to buy back Yearn tokens to be decided what to do with at a later date.

**Bull Trapper:** 

**[07:14]** So, those are kind of the things that Yearn has done to tackle some of those problems that you mentioned, which I think we have a good solution doing that because, you know, you can't ask the token holders every time you need to make an expense out like, "Hey, do we approve this or not," because that's just far too cumbersome. So we've developed smaller Y teams that act on behalf of governance token holders as stewards. And you know, our primary focus is: keep operations running, fund developers, onboard new developers, help out operations that we need to keep the protocol running and think about growth and also being hedged against volatile crypto prices or something that could shut down operations. So, we're doing all that simultaneously.

**Darcy Allen:**

**[08:03]** I completely agree with that. That's really interesting. I take a little bit more of a theoretical perspective, I guess, around why do treasuries exist. I think there's two broad reasons. The first one is very obvious and it's the one that most treasuries state: we have a treasury because it's there to fund some kind of local public goods; we don't tend to define them very well; we say those local public goods are research development, marketing, ecosystem incentives, whatever the ecosystem might need in the future. Then that's really interesting because we need treasuries because blockchains don't have governments, but they might need some goods that would be under provided by effectively private stakeholders within the ecosystem. So we're thinking about infrastructure, bridges all of those sort of aspects, and so we use a treasury as a mechanism to try and fund those goods.

**Darcy Allen:**

**[09:00]** So that's the first reason, we have them because of local public goods funding, but the second reason and I think it's a little bit underappreciated is that treasuries act as a really important, costly signal to the ecosystem. Having a large, perhaps undiversified treasury of a native token, can signal to your ecosystem that this is a long-term play: we're going to be here for a long time; we have a really long runway; we're confident in our token price and the value of the ecosystem; we see this in other fields in economics, this idea of costly signaling, the classic example is education. You go to university to signal some traits that you have, you might be hard working or dedicated or whatever. You go and do a costly thing. You spend four years at college or university to demonstrate to employers those traits. In the same way we can think of the treasury as demonstrating some kind of credible commitment to the community. Now, there's some arguments about whether that signal gets diluted over time when everyone has a big treasury, we're yet to see that. But I think, yeah, there there's two broad reasons: local public goods funding, and then sort of signaling to your community that you have a,  large treasury itself.

**Eugene Leventhal:** 

**[10:17]** To ask a follow-on question there. I wanted to see, building on that, what are the particular complexities of treasury management in the Web3 space, relative to just generally thinking about organizational health and budgeting and making sure, you know, you have the money to fill your operations or fund public goods in a geographic area, sort of, what are the unique challenges in the Web3 space around that?

**Bull Trapper:** 

**[10:40]** Well, I think also Web3, it's interesting because it's a very young industry. A lot of people, they're younger and they just know crypto. I come also before crypto from the traditional finance space, so I know how businesses should be run, how operation should be run, how things should be funded, how you should be looking at costs and expenses. So the first thing that I've done and I did when working with Yearn is, we need to know, like our run rate, our balance sheet, I made a complete balance sheet income statement that we monitor monthly, and it's all made public. We have YFI stats, we have quarterly financial reports, year-end financial reports that put all this information public so people can see what is in treasury and how things are getting spent and stuff like that.

**Chris Berg:**

**11:28** Bull, how have you found the community respond to that? I mean, that's a level of financial, I guess, sophistication or financial assurance that most protocols don't have, is that welcomed by the community or is that seen as an unnecessary constraint in the wild Web3 world?

**Bull Trapper:** 

**[11:48]** Yeah, I've seen it as being very welcomed. So, we publish our financial reports, our quarterly ones, and they've been praised for their transparency and their level of detail, that people are surprised how professional they are. And that also signals to our community that we are professional, and we know what we're doing. We have things under control. We're not just spending frivolously. And you know, we're not doing things that we shouldn't be doing and it's all public. And I've seen in the crypto space, the Web3 space, that people have been modeling the reports after the report that we innovated and have become to be more transparent and clear on everything that's going on. So, I think the community is very responsive and well received by the things that we're publishing and showing and how we're managing it as a steward for governance.

**Chris Berg:** 

**[12:39]** Darcy to bring you in here, what Bull is describing is actually quite a, I don't know how high cost it is, but it's a high level of governance assurance that you as a community would need to allocate resources to. You've studied a lot about blockchain governance and foundation governance and crypto governance more generally. Where do you think we are in the levels of sophistication about dedicating resources to that sort of what we might view as sort of hierarchical organization or the sort of governance that you would see in the corporate sector?

**Darcy Allen:**

**[13:16]** I think the tide is turning on this, and I think it's great, Bull, what you're doing at Yearn, creating these sub-teams and then having transparency as well after the fact. There's still this sentiment that everything should happen, and every decision should be thrown out to a DAO. And I think that's slowly coming back to: maybe we need some discretionary power, maybe we need some sub-teams or committees who are undertaking those treasury management activities. What's really important from there is that we have some sort of feedback loop to those teams so that the community still has some sort of overarching control of it. But I do think we're moving into a world where, when you're structuring a DAO early on, it will become just a staple that you put within your governance design, that you have some kind of treasury management team.

**Darcy Allen:**

**[14:16]** Now, that's not really the case at the moment, but I'm hoping over time that will be built in. And I think that's a really healthy thing to have because not everything can be thrown out to the DAO for a vote, but it's really important that your community has a really good feeling about what's going on. And they feel like if something doesn't gel quite right with them, that they have some avenue to change that outcome. And what we've seen really with treasury diversification so far are discourse posts or discord posts or forum posts that say, okay, we're going to sell 5% of our treasury token to these 20 VCs at a 30% discount. And the community jumps in and says that discount's huge, and it's not vested for long enough, and this isn't a good strategic play and so on. So, I think those discussions are really healthy, but at the same time, we do need some more discretionary power within particular teams and committees to make these decisions.

**Chris Berg:**

**[15:22]** So Bull, we start in most protocols with a pre allocation to treasury so of the local token, but obviously and, you know, put that aside and hopefully the token grows in value so the treasury itself has some substantial wealth in it. But of course, there are other ways to fill up our treasury and there are other things that we can do with the treasury as well, apart from just pushing out grants and so forth. You could use ongoing revenue sources like transaction fees or so forth, or just putting fees in the system and you pop it into the treasury, in either your local token or in a stable coin, or what have you. On the other hand, you could also pay the treasury out to token holders as well. So even before we get to treasury management, there are a lot of choices that we have to make about, you know, funds going in and funds going out. How do you start, I mean, in your experience, how has Yearn been thinking through, should we pay dividends? Should we be filling up our treasury, and more generally, how do you think that the space has evolved in that thinking?

**Bull Trapper:**

**[16:27]** Yeah. And I want to add to the prior question is that I think Yearn is the most transparent and well-run DAO in DeFi and Web3, we've always had a treasury management function since the beginning, and everything that treasury does is on behalf of token holders. And they're all done in accordance to YIPs and governments proposals that have been approved by governance holders. So, there's still you know, if governance wants to change members of the multisig or change the org around, or they don't like the Y teams or how things are being structured; they always have the ability to do that and voice concerns and make changes. So, we only operate as approved YIPs that have been voted on by the DAO. I think Yearn is a very successful organization within DeFi and Web3, because it's actually making money. You know, it makes 2 to 3 million net profit every month after we pay operations, team and all that.

**Bull Trapper:**

**[17:27]** And one of the key governance proposals in recent times is what you just mentioned is like, what do we do with our earnings? So, governance has voted, we take our earnings, and we use it to buy back our tokens. So, we're buying back about 2 to 3 million per month that should be increasing in the native token, and that's all from a governance approved proposal. There's some discussions in the governance forms or within the community of, should we be changing kind of this value accrual mechanism? So those are still ongoing, but everything that we do, we do based on approved governance, YIPs - Yearn Improvement Proposals.

**Chris Berg:**

**[18:10]** I mean, that's a really interesting thing; and obviously as you've described it, Yearn, you are implementing the governance proposal, so you contribute to those discussions, but obviously they're not your discussions necessarily to decide solely. But it is interesting to think about, let's say, if a DAO like Yearn, or just a crypto DAO, is a startup; well, a lot of token holders have been calling for exactly what that is, which is try to take the treasury and try to get the value of the treasury to revert back to token holders, effectively in some way paying dividends like a traditional company would. But it does strike me, and I'm just interested in your perspective. It strikes me that if these are startup companies, or if these are startup companies in the real world, then paying out dividends, returning a treasury to shareholders is remarkable at this early stage of the industry. Do you think that they we're making the right choices, or do you think that maybe even the incentive structures have to be worked on to make sure that when we get treasury, we are actually spending it and building out the protocol? Or am I making a problem out of nothing?

**Bull Trapper:** 

**[19:27]** It’s definitely an issue of balancing growth of the protocol and also returning value. So, we look at both and what we’ve done in recent times is grow the team, grow developers, make sure they’re all properly compensated and incentivize while also providing a good product, which I think is one of the best products in DeFi and the product actually makes money. So, a lot of protocols, they don’t have this luxury of how do they determine how to do some of these things or fund growth or return value, because they’re not really generating much value. So, Yearn generates a lot of value, and right now it’s using it to buy back the tokens and the community is the determining, are we going to change the value accrual to be something else? So, you know, those things are to be decided by the community.

**Chris Berg:** 

**[20:21]** Darcy, to bring you in here. Do you accept that this is an interesting challenge? Obviously, there's a lot of communities that would like to earn or yield on their tokens or they'd like these buybacks or burn functions to make sure that their token value is growing relative to the rest of the crypto economy. Do you think that we're making the right decisions in that sort of tokenomic structuring? Or do you think we've got a way to go?

**Darcy Allen:** 

**[20:53]** I think it's quite ecosystem specific. So, in some ecosystems, it's a little bit clearer about what the treasury might be funding, that there's sort of a lot of growth potential there that maybe a lot more should be play out into the grant program, or some developer program or whatever it happens to be. In others, and it sounds like in Yearn, and I'm not deeply versed in Yearn, but if you've got those ongoing revenue sources, and that seems very sort of clear and predictable, then I think you do have a different equation there. So, it is ecosystem specific. I do think, in general, I would like to see more treasuries being spent on ecosystem development. A lot of that might look wasteful to the community members themselves. Of course, they're going to prefer some sort of buyback in token appreciation. But, as you said, these are often early stage ecosystems, and a lot of decisions can get caught up in gridlock, but it's very okay system specific.

**Chris Berg:**

**[22:01]** Bull, when we start these treasuries, those treasuries are filled up with just our native token, which we hope is very valuable, but is often not very valuable. And I think a lot of treasuries and a lot of DAO’s have come to realize that, well, they need to diversify away from their native token. Certainly, if they’re going feel safer if there’s a crypto winter, but even if there is a downturn in the fortunes of their individual protocol. This is something that you’ve thought a lot about, where do you start thinking about the choices that we have to make if we are going to pursue a strategy of treasury diversification?

**Bull Trapper:** 

**[22:43]** Yeah. And I just want to add, you know, all the comments and things that I’m saying are just my own personal views; they don’t represent other contributors at Yearn or the community, this is just based on my experiences working at Yearn and previously in the traditional finance realm. But Yearn is unique in that a treasury wasn’t funded with the native governance token. It was a fair launch protocol where, you know, the tokens were given out to community for free for providing liquidity last July, and treasury itself did not have any tokens, so that poses several issues. And there was a governance proposal in January of this year to meet more tokens to give the treasury and for contributors, so they can be incentivized, and people could be well compensated. So. One of the important things that I saw early on was like, it needs to be diversified. There needs to be cash to fund operations, to weather down storm in the market. And in January we were negative 11 million in debt, and now we have about 27 million in cash, plus a substantial amount of the native token in treasury about 78 million. So, I think we’ve been very successful in diversifying treasury to be agnostic to marketing conditions and also growing it to be consistently growing our cash balances to ensure the health of the ecosystem and operations can continue and stuff like that.

**Chris Berg:** 

**[24:19]** So, what should you be diversifying into? So obviously, you can diversify into cash, you’ve got a huge range of alternative assets. You could diversify into sort of blue chip crypto, ETH, you could diversify into blue chip DeFi. One of which of course would be Yearn, but, you know, UNI or so forth. How do you think about the menu of options there?

**Bull Trapper:** 

**[24:41]** Well, the way I think about Yearn is that, at the end of the day, it is a business. It is a business with expenses and there’s overhead and Yearn historically has a lot of its balance sheet in crypto assets; ETH, Bitcoin, Yearn, so I think it’s always been short in cash. So, my aim and my goals from the last 11 months was to increase the cash balances so that it can pay for operations and fund growth and stuff like that. So, you know, we’ve diversified by increasing our cash balances that we need to fund operations, to keep the lights on, to keep things going. So, you know, nothing against UNI, but in Yearn’s case, it’s best for long term growth of the protocol and the operations team and everything to have a sufficient cash balance to be agnostic to the market. And that’s how we have diversified ourselves and our treasury to benefit the token holders, the protocol, and everyone in DeFi that’s using the Yearn product.

**Darcy Allen:**

**[25:44]** I just wanted to jump in and say, well, what’s really interesting is I think diversification means very different things to different ecosystems, right? So, I think over the last six months, we’ve seen a lot of treasuries that have a different approach to Yearn. They started with a bunch of their native token within their treasury, and then they decided we need to diversify. We need us to diversify in particular because a crypto winter is coming, we need to fund our operating expenses and so on and so forth. And so, let’s sell some of our native token for USDC. But what’s been wrapped up in that is this idea of strategic diversification. So, it’s not just diversification because we need some stable coin to cover operating expenses. It’s: we care who we are giving our native token to.

**Darcy Allen:**

**[26:39]** So, these VC’s that we’re selling the token to, who are they? What value are they providing to us in addition to just buying our token at a discount? And it’s really wrapped up. It’s not just a financial decision of diversifying a portfolio to get through winter. It’s also that those tokens that you’re selling have governance rights, and that might actually be quite a large portion of governance rights in your ecosystem. And we are seeing this play out in public quite often about how that relationship works.

**Chris Berg:**

**[27:14]** I mean, Darcy, communities don’t always love treasury diversification because treasury diversification, certainly poorly done, looks a hell of a lot like dumping tokens out on the market and trading them for US dollars. From your perspective, how do you see the sort of group communal decision making of the DAO affecting the ability of treasury managers to make those sorts of choices?

**Darcy Allen:** 

**[27:45]** It’s really hard. So, on one end you can see an argument why some of these deals need to be made in private with a multisig, which has happened in some ecosystems. And in other ones, they go out to the Discord or the discourse and everyone chips in, and there’s kind of some odd negotiation between the community and the token buyers, and that’s super interesting to play out. What I think we are getting from this happening in public is we are getting a lot of public learning and discovery about how this should happen or how to diversify a treasury. And yeah, it’s interesting to see where we go from here, but I think we’ve learned a lot just in the last six months about what community members think about what a reasonable discount is on selling your tokens, or how long it should be vested for; when should the governance rights kick in; it's really interesting to see all of this.

**Bull Trapper:**

**[28:54]** And I just want to on that actually, you know, part of the Yearn tokens in treasury, you know, we don’t really sell them to VCs. I don’t think VCs in crypto add value because there’s people like me in Yearn that are DeFi crypto natives. There’s people like Dontae, there’s people like Andre, like adding a VC with a discount does not really add much value to Yearn in exchange for token. So, what we do is, you know, we reward it to contributors that are actually adding value to the protocol where they’re helping with marketing, they’re helping with the web revamp, they’re developers doing treasury stuff. You know, all these other things that are adding value, not just being freeloaders, because I don’t think VCs, in our particular case, add really any value for what we’re doing. It’s more like rewarding contributors and people that are going to help the product be better, which is essentially DeFi public good.

**Chris Berg:**

**[29:51]** Bull, I mean, one of the things that we can do with our treasury is we can put it to work. So, I know that in a lot of communities there's discussion about, well: we've got a lot of USDC, why don't we yield farm that? At the limit, why don't we take half our treasury and pop it into the latest Olympus DAO fork? Obviously, you know, there are risky options and there are less risky options, but I'm sure the Yearn community has discussed the possibility of using its treasury to earn more treasury. How have you started to think about or tackle that option?

**Bull Trapper:** 

**[30:28]** Yeah, and we've been doing that for quite some time. We actually do have CDPs open with some of our Yearn tokens held in treasury and we're earning yield on them. We earn about over a million dollars a year just from that. And then we also have used our cash balances to all be earning yield in our Yearn products. So, it's something that we've thought about. I've kind of spearheaded early on when we had a large treasury balance that wasn't really yielding anything. So, we're always focused on managing our debt, earning yield on our assets and growing the treasury. If community members to feel very strongly about going to an [**inaudible **31:04], personally, I probably would be against that, but they're free to make those proposals to governance and treasury and the multisig is going to act on behalf of any valid proposal, but most of our stuff is earning yield on our assets into Yearn products. So, you know, Yearn is using Yearn is something that we we've talked about before.

**Chris Berg:**

**[31:29]** How do you think about risk though in that context? So obviously there are more risky strategies, there are less risky strategies. There are risk across lots of different margins, not just the risk of volatility, but also smart contract risk. So, you know, obviously is up to governance as you've said, but when you are advising the community about, you know, how much should we be aping into weird things - where do you start?

**Bull Trapper:** 

**[31:53]** You know, we're fairly risk averse and we're always monitoring our debt and our collateralization levels, and they're very over collateralized. And all the things that we're farming, are earning interest on are essentially cash and carry trades. So, you know, we're not using treasury assets to mint debt and then buy Bitcoin and speculating on that. You know, they're all just cash and carry trades. Let's mint something at, you know, 1 to 2 to 5% and earn 15, 20, 25%. And if there's an adverse event in the market, we pay down our debt, protect our capital, which we've done successfully. We're fairly risk averse, and we have that ability to still earn yield because the balance sheet is so big.

**Chris Berg:**

**[32:39]** Darcy, how do you think about the opportunity to, you know, put the cash to work or put the treasury to work, given that we've got this huge menu of traditional financial products or strange, weird DeFi, dGen stuff?

**Darcy Allen:**

**[32:59]** I think it goes back to why are we effectively diversifying in the first place? So, if you're trying to manage your treasury just so that you have a runway, then you can just keep it in USDC or whatever it happens to be and not take on that additional risk. If you're actually looking to grow the value of the treasury over time for its own good, then you can take on those risks. I think it looks different depending on what your purpose is of the treasury management that you're trying to achieve.

**Bull Trapper:**

**[33:34]** At Yearn, we're looking, we look at both, you know, to have runway, have 18 months two years runway, and also earn yield and increase the value of the balance sheet basically on behalf of governance. So, a lot of the things that we're doing, the strategies, they're in well tested, well audited, well looked at things like Curve. Like, you know, this is kind of the most looked at contracts in DeFi. Curve has billions of TVL, so I don't think the risk is as high as going into some new, you know, dog fork Ponzi on MATIC or something like that. You know, we don't really do any of that. And our aim is to diversify, to cover operations, to fund growth, which we're doing both; to fund growth of the protocol, so we can develop new products that add value to DeFi, and also just increase the value of treasury over time.

**Chris Berg:** 

**[34:36]** Bull, what do you think is working and what isn't working across the space? So obviously Yearn has a relatively sophisticated approach to treasury management, but where do you think that the spaces and where has it evolved, particularly given that you've got an experience in traditional finance and have seen treasuries being managed in the real world?

**Bull Trapper:** 

**[34:57]** Yeah, I think Yearn is unique because it's a very successful product and I think we're running treasury very successfully because we're very prudent with what we're doing and how we're earning yield and what we're spending our cash on, and Yearn makes money, as I've mentioned before. So, I think a problem with a lot of protocols in DeFi is they're not actually making money. You know, if they take away the token subsidies or they take away any other thing that's artificially making their protocol look better, they're operating at a net loss, so they're not cash flow positive, and also, they're not very transparent. No one knows what's really going on with treasury, but we are extremely transparent. We make all of our reports public. We have all of our wallets known and we have dashboards. People can see what's going on. So, on top of that, you know, we run a fairly sophisticated operation. I think a lot of other protocols in DeFi, they're very young, they're run by young teams, and they come upon a lot of money very quickly, so we'll see how they manage that. But one of the main things that I saw with Yearn early on is that I don't want it to end up like a dot com company. You know, they're spending money frivolously and it's not adding value. And next thing you know, you have no funding and, you don't have any cash or to keep the protocol going. So, we've avoided that, and we're in a great position to do everything we can to make sure that doesn't happen. And like other protocols in DeFi, I'm not sure that's the case, so we'll just have to see what happens with them.

**Chris Berg:** 

**[36:34]** Darcy, what advice would you give a young DAO to think about treasury management from day one? Again, these protocols tend to be born with enormous treasuries and sometimes extremely highly valued treasuries. How would you set yourself up for success?

**Darcy Allen:** 

**[36:52]** I think the challenges in the very early stage is: we don't know what a treasury is for, or even what it is that we are managing or what the future value of it might be. And that means that we end up with very broad sweeping purposes of a treasury and how it's managed. And the default there is, you know, we'll just put everything out to a DAO vote and that's fine. I think what we're going to see is a little bit more specifics in that early stage around: this is our approach to treasury management, this is how we're going to approach the problem of having a runway through volatility and constantly kind of baking that in early on. And that will look different in different ecosystems, but I think it'll just get more and more formalized right from the start, when you can have more discretionary power from those early founders to write that into whatever the treasury or the foundation or whatever is meant to be doing.

**Darcy Allen:** 

**[37:56]** I think it'll just get more specific over time. And I think that will come out of the lessons that we're learning right now about how to do it or what the sort of best practices are. But, over time, I also think that we will see, I mean, you've got two broad approaches to manage your treasury: you either try and do it in-house, maybe through a committee or whatever it happens to be, or you effectively sort of buy those services over a market and use more professional services effectively; this make or buy sort of question. I think it'll be interesting to see how professional sort of treasury management fits into this story. Does it look like a token on token sets that underlying it is an actively managed basket of assets that lots of different ecosystems buy? But yeah, it looks very different in different protocols.

**Bull Trapper:**

**[38:54]** And I just want to add on that. I think a lot of protocols they should, and they would benefit greatly by having professionals such as myself or people with professional finance backgrounds that know how treasuries and businesses should be run and to be prudent. So, whether it's in-house or they have someone helping them advising on financial matters and generating formal balance sheet and income statements and run rates, like, they should be doing all these things to really know where they sit because you can't do treasury unless you know what is in treasury; what is the composition of treasury? What is our debt? What are our assets? How much are we making? How much are we spending? So, these are all things that are very important that I'm not sure some of these other newer protocols have wrapped their head around or have the professional competency to do that.

**Darcy Allen:**

**[39:45]** And what that might look like in practicality is having sort of sub-teams or sub-DAOs with professionals in it that maybe elected or maybe however they appointed those for those positions, but I completely agree with that.

**Bull Trapper:**

**[40:00]** And with those sub-teams, it's my opinion that it's really not practical or feasible to have a lot of the normal operations and stuff like that all go through the DAO. It's just far too cumbersome, and sometimes you need to act a little bit faster or on behalf of the DAO, but it's always in their best interest. But running like a governance forum post, like: “Hey, should we spend 25,000 on this?” And then it's like a week or something, like that's not really a solution or a long-term solution, really. So, at Yearn, we've pioneered the smaller Y team committees to do security, to do comms, to do operations, to do marketing, to do treasury, to do budget, to do farming, to do all these things that need to be done, sometimes very fast, especially security and stuff like that.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[41:00]** It's been interesting hearing this conversation because on the one hand, we have this inherent new sector, Web3, there's a lot of folks who are supposedly ideologically driven, there's the folks who are just aping in for some kind of immediate returns; no need to speculate on the proportions of the two. I was sort of... This made me think of an interesting tension, right? Because part of it very much sounds like, and I know just from reputation of sort of what can set apart Yearn, or some of the other very mature organizations relative to sort of the vast majority of players in the space, is that maturity. It is that kind of learning how to not just pretend we're in this Greenfield wild west kind of area, but recognizing there's actually decades, if not centuries of previous knowledge that can easily be integrated and applied.

And, I want to come to a question around culture of treasury management; because it seems as though, depending on the initial crew who are launching a DeFi product, because there's a whole psychology of that, that we could dig into in a separate podcast of why do people do the things they do, but at the end of the day, it's really hard to suss out any activity in the Web3 space from potential token holding and from potential gains and HODLs and anything along those lines. 

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[42:18]** So, I would be interested from both of your perspectives; if you were advising someone who comes to you and is like: “hey, I really want to start a DeFi product, not just for the returns, but I really want to do this because I see Web3 as an important future infrastructure layer, and I will want to build on top of that.” And I know both of you already touched on this in terms of the actual treasury management nuances, but how to think of the human components to get people excited about maturity, as opposed to just, well, who cares, let's just do the thing that'll get them largest immediate returns. How do you get the right culture around that for people to want to do the hard journey of let's grow up and mature and be the best version of ourselves?

**Darcy Allen:** 

**[42:58]** That's an incredibly difficult question. I'm not sure, Bull, do you have any thoughts on that?

**Bull Trapper:**

**[43:03]** Yeah. Well, I would like to just say that, you know, it's important to make sure everyone is properly incentivized long term then there's skin in the game. So, you know, whether you have members of your treasury team, they're getting vested tokens, or they have other things that are looking to long term health of the protocol and the token as well, so that they're properly incentivized for long term viability. And I think aligning the incentives, which we've done at Yearn with contributors is very critical to ensure that like all parties are operating in the best interests of the protocol and of token holders and of the contributors, because the contributors themselves are token holders. So, I think that's the most effective way to deal with that.

**Darcy Allen:**

**[43:58]** I think it's a really hard problem to solve. And, in part, it goes back to what we were speaking about earlier, that when you're talking about, for instance, diversifying your treasury, or selling some of your treasury, it does matter who purchases them, right? And there is a very different vibe if it is going to VCs where it's locked for one year and maybe they'll dump a bunch of it after that year along their vesting schedule or whatever it happens to be. That has a very different feel to diversifying using a batch option to the community or creating a smart pool and diversifying it that way. And it feels different. You end up with the same tokens at the end of the day, but the makeup of the community is very different, and it gives a different vibe. I'm not sure there's any easy answers to your question, Eugene. I'm not sure. We'll figure that out over time, I guess.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[44:56]** And so, I guess to ask a more specific question then, you know, Bull was mentioning the importance of incentive alignment skin in the game, I mean, these are obviously important concepts in general for Web3, given how game theoretic a lot of these things are, but I mean, are these incentives purely financial, or have you seen any non-financial incentives also get rolled into the full schema of skin in the game for someone and why they should stick around in the long term?

**Bull Trapper:**

**[45:21]** Well, I think you know, that that’s on an individual basis. Some people are going to be passionate about Web3; I’m passionate about Web3, DeFi and what Yearn is doing in particular, so, I’m going to be involved, but there is a financial component that needs that’s important, so it’s a hard question. I think comes down to the individual person. But we aim to reward people that are adding value within the community, and eventually they come on board as contributors to Yearn, and have shown continuous value. So, it’s a hard question to answer. I think there’s definitely the financial component, but also finding people that are passionate about, and there’s plenty of people within the Yearn community and Yearn contributors that are passionate about Yearn. You know, Dontae and a few of the other public people within Yearn, they’re very passionate about what Yearn’s doing. It’s not solely financial compensation. I think making sure you you’re getting people that aren’t just looking for the quick buck is going to be the most long term viable.

**Darcy Allen:**

**[46:26]** I mean, one of the ways that we do that is we target our airdrops in very specific ways now, compared to previously. We'll target it based on past behavior of demonstrating that passion that Bull's talking about. It's largely financially stage basically.

**Bull Trapper:** 

**[46:44]** Well, also to add on that, you know, I don't think the airdrops in DeFi are very good methods of distribution. They're very, you know, you see divergence ventures, they're all these, you know, VC’s, they're in the seed and then they do the airdrops and then they dump the token day one. So, like, I don't think the airdrops are really good methods and our aim is: give it to people that are actually adding value, and they're there, and they've shown that they're going to be there for the long time. It's like avoiding any sort of free loaders, so I don't think there's really any free loaders in the Yearn organization, so I think that's important too. And sometimes VCs in crypto, they're just there to get the seed, get their a hundred X and then they dump the tokens on retail and stuff like that. We don't really have any VCs that are, that are in that position that got the token price, you know, at unfair discount to anyone else. The token is free to so buy on, you know, the DEXs, it's on Binance, Coinbase, so everyone's on the same level field. There's no VC unlock coming in three months and it's going to just dump all over retail.

**Darcy Allen:**

**[47:56]** And this also comes to, I think we are going to see more and more tools, which we are seeing at the moment around rewarding those kinds of contributions that you're talking about, Bull, in terms of the value that people are actually providing to the system. So, tools like Coordinape and so on that are attempts to try and capture those contributions and a long-term commitment to the protocol.

**Bull Trapper:**

**[48:16]** Yeah. And Coordinape is a great example. And it's one of the things that Yearn has innovated, and because it's such a decentralized organization entity, DAO, you know, however you want to call it. Anyone is free to contribute and you, all you have to do is come contribute start poking around the Telegram, Discord, talk to some of the current contributors. There's something for everyone in Yearn, so I think keeping the door open for everyone and it's very open, transparent, and welcoming, and there's all different types of people doing any sort of task or activity within Yearn. It's not solely developer. It's a wide variety of people and it's always open for anyone to contribute. And, as long as you're adding value, I think you'll get rewarded in due time.

**Eugene Leventhal:** 

**[49:12]** And I think there might be a bit of a misnomer from folks outside Web3, that it's: oh, if I want to come play, whether it's DeFi specific or in general, in any of these new protocols, I have to be a tech wizard, and I need to know how to have a code everything in and out; and that's just not necessarily the reality. And as you were mentioning the importance of traditional finance backgrounds and people who just know traditional treasury management, porting that over to crypto treasuries is very relevant. Are either one of you seeing particular skill sets or knowledge bases that are, if not lacking, at least would be helpful to have more of, in terms of the conversations of planning these kinds of treasuries?

**Bull Trapper:**

**[49:52]** Yeah, definitely. And I think it's definitely not solely developers. So, you know, we have a marketing team, we have an entire web team, you know, they're not doing the core product smart contracts Yearn involves. They're helping with website, and we've recently onboarded a marketing personnel that came from a large tech company that everyone would know. So, he's not a solidity developer, but he adds a lot of value in our marketing and comms branch. We have very regular newsletters and all sorts of things to keep our community informed of what is going on. It's not solely just developers, comms, legal, finance, operations, you know, people kind of like an HR role - all sorts of things. So, it's not just developers. And at the end of the day, it's an organization, a decentralized organization with people all throughout the world, all different backgrounds, so the door is open for anyone. And I think a lot of other organizations, they lack in that other non-technical aspect of their organizations, they're solely developers. They don't have good coms, they don't have good marketing, they don't have the treasury like function nailed down, so they're lacking in a lot of other aspects that they're overlooking. I think eventually, over time, it's going to be quite challenging for them because these are things that you need for a properly functioning organization, even a DAO.

**Darcy Allen:**

**[51:38]** I completely agree. And, one of the ways that we like to think about this is - yes, these ecosystems are of course businesses, right? And, they have treasuries and they're trying to achieve some objective and so on and so forth, but we're also effectively building little mini economies, right. And, to build an economy, you need to have a whole range of different skills to make decisions about, you know: how's the token structured, how do you diversify the treasury? How do we market this? What's the right level of ecosystem incentives? All the things that are required to build an economy generally have some place within these ecosystems. And I think that a lot of ecosystems are getting better at coordinating this. It's seen as important to bring those people into the ecosystem, and I think that's a really healthy thing. And yeah, it's great. I'm optimistic about this.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[52:32]** Yeah. I know just, since DeFi summer took hold of those a year and a half ago or so, it's been interesting.  I'm honestly surprised there haven't been more economists getting pulled in or that, you know, I know from my previous role in working at Carnegie Mellon, and some of the conversations we were having there and still today, you know, lack of focus on the UI UX, as some of these tools is always surprising. And I always am happy when I actually encounter one that is somewhat intuitively usable, which is a rarity in its own, but regardless. We're unfortunately coming to the end of our time together here, so I do just want to wrap up with a single last question of sort: what are you most excited for going into the new year in terms of, whether it's treasury management specifically, or DeFi overall?

**Bull Trapper:**

**[53:19]** I think for Yearn, you know, we're having discussions of tokenomics upgrades of, are we thinking about the best way to accrue value for token holders in the community, so we're ongoing discussions for that. I think there's going to be a revamp that's exciting for all Yearn token holders in the community, and also, continuing to innovate and have new products coming out and adding value to DeFi and the product and making it a better product is things that I'm excited about at Yearn. And, I think, also just to highlight, like Yearn now has about two, three years runway in cash covering our overhead. You know, we have about 27 million in cash that covers our expenses for 18 months, two years, two and a half years. So, I think no matter what happens with Bitcoin or Ethereum, or even DeFi, you know, we're going to be continuing to build, continuing to be there, and continuing to add value and continuing to innovate. So, these are all the things that I'm excited for.

**Darcy Allen:** 

**[54:24]** I'm excited to DAO all the things in 2022. And it's really interesting having these conversations. And this was about treasury management specifically, but there's a whole range of these same conversations going on around: how do you build these new types of Web3 native organizations, and in six months’ time or a year's time, I'm very bullish on having a lot more information and a lot more past experience around how you solve these problems. And that's really exciting for Web3, generally. We'll have a much better idea of how to manage a treasury in two months’ time, let alone, six months’ time or a year. And we'll have way more tools, we'll have way more talent within the ecosystems, and that just makes me really, really, excited, so it's been great to be here.

**Eugene Leventhal:** 

**[55:17]** I mean, in the crypto space months is years, so yeah, it'll be interesting to see how quickly we evolve. We do really appreciate all of you joining and thank you to Chris for helping lead the conversation and to Bull and Darcy for joining.

**Bull Trapper:**

**[55:30]** Thank you very much for having me on.

**Darcy Allen:**

**[55:32]** Thanks very much.
