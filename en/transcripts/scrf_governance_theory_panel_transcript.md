## Transcript

**Eugene Leventhal:**

Hello and welcome to one of our two panels on governance organized by the Smart Contract Research Forum or SCRF. [00:14] I'm Eugene Leventhal, the Operations Lead here at SCRF, and I have the pleasure of moderating today's panel alongside SCRF's Founder, Richard Brown. In the panel today, we're going to get into some theoretical questions surrounding governance and decentralized communities broadly, and DAOs specifically. And I'm excited to have our panelists today. That's Professor Ellie Rennie, Josh Tan, who's a Ph.D. candidate, Dr. Michael Zargham, and Professor Quinn Dupont. And so now we'll just go ahead and do a round of introductions before Professor Ellie Rennie will kick us off with a short presentation and then we'll get into a moderated discussion. So first, do you mind going, Josh, please?

**Joshua Tan:**

Sure. Thanks, Eugene, for having me. [1:01] Hi everyone, I'm Josh. I am a Ph.D. student in computer science, at the University of Oxford where I'm really trained as a pure mathematician, but I also do a lot of research on online governance. Particularly, I help run a research group called Medigov, which does a lot of work developing standards and infrastructure for online communities and online governance spanning, the gamut from social networks to online games to, of course, the blockchain.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

Great. Thank you, Josh. Next up, Michael Zargham.

**Michael Zargham:**

[1:35] Hi, thanks for having me. So I'm the Founder and sort of Chief Engineer, although also CEO of a research and design firm called BlockScience. We do quite a bit of work on algorithms for a variety of social and economic platforms, mostly blockchain-related, but not exclusively. My background is actually in large-scale distributed and decentralized resource allocation problems, like large-scale logistics. For lack of a better term, it's the sort of old version of decentralized resource algorithms. If we say that blockchains and smart contracts are the new version of that, though, I might argue that it's all the same thing and that we're just using new tools. Awesome new tools, but no tools nonetheless. And I'm also one of the original founders of the Commons Stack, and an early contributor and member of the Token Engineering community, as well as a member of the Medigov group that Josh alluded to. And I'm affiliated with the University of Economics and Business in Vienna.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

Great, thank you Zargham. And next up, Professor Quinn DuPont.

**Quinn Dupont:**

Thanks, Eugene.[2:52], I'm an assistant professor at the School of Business, at University College Dublin. I did my Ph.D. in information science at University of Toronto. And before that, I did enterprise risk management at IBM and did my postdoc University of Washington. And these days my affiliations are pretty broad. I work extensively with the IEEE[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers], in the past, I've done some standard-setting work with the ISO[International Organization for Standardization], I'm a research affiliate at UC London, and so on and so forth. And I've studied crypto broadly. Since about 2012, I wrote a nice little green book, called Cryptocurrencies and Blockchains with Polity and a number of other articles and whatnot. And that's me, Quinn DuPont. Thank you.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

Thank you. Next up please, Ellie Rennie.

**Ellie Rennie:**

[3:54] Yeah. Hi. So I work at our RMIT University in the Blockchain Innovation Hub, but I'm also involved with something called the Digital Ethnography Research Center. And the reason why that's important is my research is really, focused on trying to understand the people within these blockchain systems and how they interact with the software actors, which is what I'm going to talk a little bit about today. Would you like me to start with that, Eugene?

**Eugene Leventhal:**

Yeah, please feel free to jump right in.

**Ellie Rennie:**

[Screen sharing begins 4:38] Okay. So I'm going to share my screen for a moment. I'm going to trust that this is visible and that you will tell me if it's not. One of the questions that we were asked to think about in the lead-up to this panel is, what is governance? So I'm putting a definition here, which is that to govern is to structure the field of action available to others. I'm either paraphrasing or directly quoting Foucault here, I believe. But I think it's relevant from whatever perspective, theoretical perspective you're coming from, in fact. And as a qualitative researcher and someone who uses participant observation in my research methods, I'm always trying to figure out, so who are the actors in this particular system? And when we're talking about DAOs, we're talking about human and machine, in this case, software-based actors who are structuring that field of action, right?

**Ellie Rennie:**

So, and from an ethnographic perspective, we want to try to understand the interaction. And I suppose some of the power dynamics that are going on there too. [5:36] So what kind of actor is a DAO? So Aaron Wright, in his recent essay has a nice little description of a DAO, which is that code forms a cohesive network of hard-to-change rules that establish the standards and procedures of anyone interacting with or taking part in a DAO. What I quite like about this is that he is emphasizing how it changes the actions of people taking part, but of course, because he comes from a legal perspective, he does have this emphasis on the rules, on the smart contracts. [6:13] And for me, if I'm thinking of what is the function of a DAO? What is the software agent here?

**Ellie Rennie:**

It is probably more like a bureaucrat than a lawyer. I don't think of it so much as the rules, but the thing that is enacting in those rules. So it's providing services to a public, with varying degrees of autonomy, from that public, according to rules that are set by the political principle, which is either the members of the DAO or it could be the founders who established the DAO prior to those people being brought into it. Which for me, makes me think, how do we then assess this kind of software-based bureaucracy? [Slide advances 6:57] And there was an essay written in 2013 by Francis Fukuyama, which I found kind of useful for thinking through this. I'm not entirely convinced, but I thought I'd throw it out there as a talking point at least, where he talks about, measuring the performance of bureaucracies and the infrastructural power of bureaucracies, as opposed to the despotic power or rules and rulemaking that goes on, and influences what that bureaucracy does.

**Ellie Rennie:**

[7:28] So the two measures that he puts forward are autonomy and capacity. So in capacity, he's talking about the merit of that bureaucracy. For instance, its ability to extract taxes successfully. And on the negative side, it could be the corruption of the bureaucracy as well. And autonomy is the degree of scope to implement programs without direction from the political principal, whoever that may be. And I think this is a useful definition really when it comes to blockchain, sorry, we're going in the wrong direction there. [8:00] Except that I would probably tweak it a little bit where autonomy would perhaps include automation. And I think capacity would be the sophistication as well of that particular DAO and what it's used for and what it's doing. So if you've got low capacity, and high automation, you've got some problems, maybe the DAO was one of those examples.

**Ellie Rennie:**

[8:31] And where there's too many rules, and low capacity, maybe that's where you kind of get clientelism, the kind of, problems where people might be directing funds to close associates or even to themselves. And what's starting to be referred to as governance extractable value in various form [Slide advances 8:53] The other thing I quite like about thinking about them as bureaucracies is that things like babies, DAOs, and minion DAOs as they're sometimes called, we can start to see them as offices within a government department. So where majority of a small DAO is representative from another DAO. So, and how you allocate tasks to people with specific expertise to govern over a subset of issues. And then of course, things like having large investors controlling a significant proportion of many DAOs has an influence over the wider system, which I think we also need to keep in mind that when we're thinking about DAOs, it's not just the singular DAO, it's the interaction of DAOs, within a broader decentralized system that is also, important here.

**Ellie Rennie:**

[9:43] As I mentioned before, allowing an entity to vote on its own proposal can be problematic. And I think that the way that we think of DAOs and autonomy comes into this. So of course automation is only good with a high degree of capacity. And we need to consider where we're automating particular processes and functions and services, the extent to which the tasks that have been carried out are suitable for that. [Slide advances 10:22] So, one another question that we were asked to think about, and I'm sure we're going to come back to this is that, what are DAOs? Should they be democratic in terms of, not so much the machine, but the people in this instance in how we organize those who are directing this software-based actor.

**Ellie Rennie:**

[10:40] And I would say that bureaucracies existed under monarchies, not just democracies, and some bureaucracies were founded under authoritarian role. Germany is an example that's sometimes given here, but are actually very high functioning, now under democracies whereas some which were started under democratic circumstances have been a lot messier, as public or civil services. So, the question then is, should DAOs be democratic? Probably not.

**Ellie Rennie:**

[11:16] And maybe things like an investment DAO should have a tighter control by a particular group of agents or founders, and there are various choices that are going to go on here. But what I would say, and this is where I'm going to conclude is that in decentralized systems, I do think that there will be a tendency towards democracy. And that is, I think of this in terms of the monitoring function of the democratic type of politics whereby, and I love this quote from John Keane and he uses this term monetary democracy, essentially, I should say, to describe the various kinds of constellations of monitoring, auditing organizations that fall sideways and downwards through the political system in the kind of complex, society that we now have.

**Ellie Rennie:**

[12:18] So not just the state, there are various types of things performing that role. And I think DAOs are doing that within a decentralized blockchain system too. [12:25] And he says, "Democracy recognized that although people were not angels or gods or goddesses, they were at least good enough to prevent some humans from thinking they were." And I think that what I love about that quote with respect to the conversation that we're about to have is that, that's the era of monitoring keeping check, and that this is the function of those of us who are within DAOs as members, influencing these bureaucratic software agents. So I'm going to leave it there and everyone feel free to disagree with me or take this in an entirely different direction.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

That's great. Thank you so much for presenting there, Ellie. And feel free to close the share, but yeah, I know Zargham, I believe, wanted to respond on something on the democracy side to kick us off.

**Michael Zargham:**

[13:18] Yeah, actually, it's really more of a clarifying discussion because I think democracy is often a term used in this space, but I think we tend to take, maybe it's a narrow view of it in the context of certain rituals or procedures. Like we think of democracy as being, identical to, there's a voting process. When I would say it's kind of important, given the context that Ellie provided, to think of it more as like a strong feedback loop between the sort of, let's just say the governed and the decision-making that governs or structures the field. And so when we think about it in feedback loop terms, the monitoring concept becomes critical.

**Michael Zargham:**

[13:59] But so too does just the fact that the feedback loop itself can be present and ineffectual or present and biased towards a certain subgroup. We talk about, wealth and plutocracy in this particular community. And I really want to take time to pause and say democracy from a lived experience perspective is going to be more like feeling and actually having some way of feeding back information to the system in which you are participating. And so we don't necessarily need to say, it's democracy because it's voting. And in fact, sometimes it's voting and it's really not a very democratic feeling.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

Quinn, I don't know if you want it to jump in there.

**Quinn Dupont:**

[14:43] Yeah. I'd love to. So thanks also, Ellie for kicking us off. I think that was really illustrative and, I'm really glad Zargham picked up that, so here's my take. So funnily enough, I start with Foucault as well, when I think about conceptualizing governance. The other phrase he uses is, "It's conduct of conduct." But you have the slightly longer version there. And he says it leads to this paradox in the liberal West, we assume that liberalism asserts the sovereignty of the free individual. But then government of course requires the individual behavior be regulated or modified. And so I thought it was really interesting about your take was that you really started at a political perspective, right? It was very much a manifestation of politics.

**Quinn Dupont:**

[15:28] You said it provides services to a public. And then, I kind of think of it as at the very top, then there's a level down, which is where I actually where I kind of conceptualize governance. I think of it as really much more in organizational terms. So I think it's a form of decision-making, specifically for dealing with collective action problems. And there, I really pick up on the language of Elinor Ostrom and finding the place where at least good governance has an opportunity to chart the waters between a simple market and the problems that simple markets provide. Markets are great, but of course, they can lead to all sorts of abuses and inequality and so on and so forth, but of course, there's sophisticated markets with which we would want and things like DAOs could use.

**Quinn Dupont:**

[16:20] So neither a simple market nor a centralized government. Right? And so it's the in-between. And then of course, and this is where I'm still glad I'd love to hear more from Zargham and maybe Josh as well. And then there's the level of that's down below furthermore and that's mechanism. That's as a mechanism, right? So you've got the political, some sort of organizational framing, and then you've got the mechanism or maybe system, or whatever kind of term you want to use there. So I just would, just as a reflection as sort of seeing these different characterizations.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

Josh, please feel free.

**Joshua Tan:**

[16:48] I'd love somehow that we're on this Foucault kick, and I almost really want to go down it. But I'm going to temper and be a little bit more humble, and go with something that I know a little bit more about. I guess like this idea of DAOs as a form of administration is kind of, I don't know, it strikes me as a little bit off because I guess in my interactions with DAOs, I almost perceive them as a barrier to administration or a barrier to proper administration, which is like, I have an organization and it's making decisions.

**Joshua Tan:**

[17:24] And in very few cases, does the actual DAO infrastructure, the technical infrastructure that we call the DAO, i.e the smart contract, which is just a piece of technology for collectively administering some sort of wallet, right? Actually comes into play in the actual organizational administration, right? It glances off of that infrastructure, but it's just a piece of thing you have to check. It's almost like a form you have to fill. So in that sense again, okay, it's a piece of administration, but it's not like the administrator yet. I don't know. Maybe I'm giving more credit to administrators than is properly due. Yeah. Maybe I'll just pose that there. And question the position of the DAO.

**Ellie Rennie:**

[18:10] Yeah. Just a response to that. For me, it's what is the thing that's being automated when we use DAOs, and we are people, we are not machines. We are decision-makers, we are performing fairly well-rehearsed and historical roles within these DAOs that probably don't really need to be labored over other than, they require a bit more coordination because we're doing them online and we're doing them across borders and often without identity, which makes it really bloody hard. So for me, it's more about what is the software actor? Why is it significant and what in the long run are we hoping that these things are for, in a system of governance? So I agree with everything that's been said, it's more trying to account for how these network of interactions can be observed as an ethnographer. That's all. That's my only starting point and yeah, I mean, putting Francis Fukuyama together with Foucault, it's an absolute crime for anyone watching, I totally get that. And I'm probably more on the Foucaultian side, but I did quite like that framework.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

Zargham, you wanted to jump in?

**Michael Zargham:**

[19:38] Yeah, I did. So I wanted to touch on two things from Josh and kind of tie it back to some stuff Ellie said. One relates to bureaucracy and one to automation and kind of relates them, or maybe anti relates them. On one hand, bureaucracy provides a sort of rather interesting, low pass filtering or slowing action that actually increases the sustainability. So if you're talking about changing the structuring or changing the field of play for others, you can imagine that can't change very fast. Like if it changed fast, it would lose most of its value to them. It needs to be able to change, but the slowing effects are not necessarily all bad. I know we sometimes think about blockers are slowing or impedances today with administration of an organization as blockers from our own perspectives, acting within that system and wanting to get done the thing we want to get done, but at a system scale, actually, that impedance is a desirable and arguably, evolutionary trait of organizations, because it keeps them from thrashing themselves out of existence.

**Michael Zargham:**

[20:42] On the other end, automation provides a sort of the fast equivalent. So if something is sufficiently automated, then it's also reliable, but it's reliable in the sense that, it's real-time or near real-time. And you do the thing and you have a high expectation of its execution, according to the sort of intended protocol or the intended process. And so weirdly enough, they're on opposite ends of the temporal spectrum from very fast to very slow, but they both provide the same kind of net let's say, effect on your lived experience, which is about consistency of expectation when you interact with something that's greater than yourself.

**Michael Zargham:**

[21:22] And I think the reason I like to push on this is because ultimately if we think of the DAOs or these organism organizations as sort of greater than the sum of their parts, then you have to remember that the DAOs may have relationships to people, but we also have people's relationships to the DAOs. And one of the most important attributes for people's relationship to an organization they're within is some level of trust or consistency in that relationship. And so, it's sort of opposite of the desire to be able to make it do the thing you want, because you want to do it.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

Rich, you wanted to jump in? Still muted.

**Richard Brown:**

[22:09] Sorry. I'm vaguely hesitant to raise the topic and feel free to shut me down. But one of the challenges I've had in this space over the last few years is that the word DAO is a euphemism and everybody brings a different definition of that word to the table. And I want to sort of clarify that for the purposes of this discussion. When we say DAO, are we talking about, is it a slow committee? Is it a co-op? Is it an organization of individuals? We have some form of treasury management, some form of polling mechanism for decisions, and some form of communication channel, or are we talking about something that's a little more aspirational where there's rules and regulations and guidelines that are sort of been codified into another contract that speak to the mission of these organizations? Does that make sense?

**Michael Zargham:**

[22:59] I suspect everyone might have their own answer. I'm happy to-

**Richard Brown:**

Yeah, that's tricky problem [crosstalk 00:23:23].

**Michael Zargham:**

[23:04]… but, I mean, I generally think of them, I wouldn't say aspirational, I would say that DAO as a term, both decentralized and autonomous are like historically political terms and you can look up their sort of canonical definitions. And if you think of them as adjectives modifying the word organization, then you're just talking about an organization where the power not reside in a single group, it's spread out amongst the political actors, which is maybe about what's inside of it or the power relation within it.

**Michael Zargham:**

[23:34] And then the autonomy relates to its power relation with others. So it's again, relatively autonomous in the sense that you wouldn't anticipate anything other than its internal bits providing most of its agency, but that's still very much a kind of academic approach I would say, and it's really just taking the terms at face value in their sort of historical-political context. Rather than trying to use the term the way that I say, people aren't attaching meaning to it in this space.

**Ellie Rennie:**

[24:06] Also though, I think there's a spectrum for what is a DAO, and many of them right now may have a voting system or deliberation forum, but who actually signs off on those decisions is probably four people in a noiseless safe or something like that. And therefore, I still think that they are DAOs, and we probably need better tools. And I think some are emerging around how to keep those particular power holders accountable. But yeah, I think the DAO is a system of inputs from various people and even within DAO, there are these microstructures of who has more influence than others.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

Quinn?

**Quinn Dupont:**

[25:14] Yeah, thanks, Ellie. I want to pick up on your comment around this continuum idea, right? I think that's correct. I think there's a continuum between, sort of utopian idealism and really, the reality. The reality tends to get ground down by law and regulation, right? And this is a conversation probably, we could have about what that means. Everything from where are you going to domicile this thing to what kinds of laws might support it or make it difficult, so on and so forth. But sort of more abstract from that even, I think we're also in that sort of continuum between idealism or realism, there's a bunch of cultural expectations that we just sort of just bring to the table. We often don't even necessarily think about them. And I think two really important ones are transparency and granularity, right?

**Quinn Dupont:**

[26:00] Because, there's no reason for a DAO necessarily to be transparent, but we tend to think of it as there's some insight about how it's functioning, and that people can control it and do things with it, right? In granularity, this is one of these classic challenges around everything from direct democracy to various forms of organizational structures, right? From a classic, hierarchical company to one that's very, very horizontal or whatever. And those are important decisions that one needs to make when constructing these things and then of course their software tools enable us, really sophisticated opportunities for both transparency and granularity. Right? Where you can do all sorts of exciting things using markets auctions and so on and so forth and voting, whatever and all these kinds of things to make those very, very efficient. But those are really just, I think, cultural expectations that we bring to the table.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

[27:03] Josh, I also want to make sure to give you a chance to respond in case there's any other elements of this, before kind of zooming in on a certain aspect of what's been covered in just how variable the definitions can be and trying to think of, well, what are the characteristics that differentiate a set of people working with a set of smart contracts? At what point do they become a DAO? And sort of where might the line be drawn there?

**Johsua Tan:**

[27:34] I guess I relatively little say because I find the conversation kind of necessarily inconclusive. I guess, maybe this is another way of saying it, just look at it empirically, who calls themselves a DAO? How is this language used? If you just collect all the DAOs, you'll be able to see probably a fairly obvious pattern. And then that will be essentially the sort of continuing definition of a DAO. I guess the more interesting thing that I think Zargham hinted at, is this or both Zargham and Quinn sort of, I'm sure we're leading into is this distinction between the formal and informal governance or what Quinn sort of described as granularity. And it's kind of interesting to me because if you look at, how do I say it?

**Joshua Tan:**

[28:24] Algorithm is not quite the right word, maybe the UX with a sort of the design of most DAOs, kind of inscribed a certain kind of process for how to interact with it, how to get money out of it and how to sort of send things. But the actual pragmatics of this tool, are still very much evolving and kind of unknown to most people that sort of start using this technology. And it's sort of like just saying, I was just having a conversation about the switch, why it comes up, but if you're registering a new nonprofit, you can get the algorithm. This is step one, step two, step three, step four. People write up in paragraphs, could see this everywhere.

**Joshua Tan:**

[29:06] But that doesn't like show you the lived experience of this is actually how you start a nonprofit. This is all just sort of weird decisions you have to make and the conversations you have to have, and the same thing kind of applies for DAOs. And I feel like that's a really good point that Quinn was making about this granularity, that we really don't totally understand, what's exists at that level or that it is not really properly documented, which is why I think it's still so incredibly important that, people like Ellie and her team are doing this work of really going in and seeing like, "Oh these is actually getting used." And can we write that down somewhere?

**Eugene Leventhal:**

Zargham, you wanted to jump in?

**Michael Zargham:**

[29:48] Yeah. I want to use, and I think some of you guys have heard this kind of thought experiment before about DAOs, but I'm going to make a point about the difference between using the term DAO and sort of like the actual concepts that the terms bring about. And in, in this example, we're going to say that we have one organization that calls itself a DAO, but that does it for largely regulatory arbitrage reasons and has a small, sort of multisig that while extensively holds votes or discussions, they exert a degree of sort of authority over everyone's opinions and, or largely just gather the support they need to push through proposals that are again, largely sourced from that group. And although that organization may use any number of smart contracts and tools to facilitate the administration of these processes, the power is still very clearly centralized.

**Michael Zargham:**

[30:46] But if you looked at the data, you would see that they call themselves a DAO and that they use these smart contracts, and there's some level of participation, yada, yada, and then you might have another organization which uses little or no tooling. And maybe at most, they have a single smart contract that is a multi-sig that manages their funds, but then they use discord and discourse and a variety of other tools to create a productive and highly democratic consensus-building exercise where lots of different people contribute ideas and you can see the evolution of the proposals to meet multiple stakeholder's group's needs. And then it gets, again, administrated by, okay, the stewards who have the keys of the multi-sig go and push the buttons, perform the ritual, say distribute the funds or enact the code change.

**Michael Zargham:**

[31:35] And in doing so, they maybe don't even call themselves a DAO, or maybe they don't feel like they get to because they don't have all the bells and whistles and the tooling. But from a, maybe from a first-principles perspective, they're much more DAO-like or maybe it's better to dispense with the term entirely and just assess those two organizations for their attributes. And I use this example in part because there's actually almost no way to tell them apart or worse yet you might interpret them in the opposite if you weren't doing ethnographic work. If you weren't going in and talking to the members of those communities and asking them questions about their experiences and the extent to which they feel heard or empowered because by the data, just by the code and by the metrics, it would look like the first one was really decentralized, but it's not. And the second one would look really centralized, but it's not. And so I really think it's important to actually use that, to show how much the data can't tell us, at least the raw data that's not been complemented by ethnographic work.

**Quinn Dupont:**

[32:43] If I can jump in, I think that's a really important insight and which is why I think hierarchical structure is not a great metric for thinking about what a DAO is. Zargham, you mentioned the word governance, sort of let's return to that. And we've got a good number of options available and that we can sort of just sort of think through the one that we all know of course is open source software governance. The tagline is rough consensus and running code. Right? That doesn't necessarily have anything to do with what we would characterize as a DAO-like structure, right? I mean, it can be actually kind of benevolent dictator type of stuff. On the other sort of extreme, we've got corporate governance, right? IT management, how did a standard company make an IT change, right?

**Quinn Dupont:**

[33:44] You know change management type functions in a corporation. And so I think probably what the sort of important differentiator comes around how that governance itself functions, and how that consensus comes to be. And there, this goes to, Zargham, you mentioned it, right? These are how these inputs get in, on to the system. What kind of structures are they using there? I think we have a relatively narrow range that do tend to be used today. They tend to be well, broadly speaking, things that can be economic really.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

[34:26] I want to take this opportunity to maybe quickly go around and clearly articulate what each individual is thinking when they use the term governance because that itself is something that, as we've already heard in different contexts can mean slightly different things. So, it would be great to kind of just go around. Whoever's willing to jump in first and kind of give what they view as their working definition of governance, given the context of this conversation.

**Quinn Dupont:**

I mean, I'm happy to. Sorry Ellie, go ahead.

**Ellie Rennie:**

No, no, go ahead.

**Quinn Dupont:**

[34:58] My mindset, I think I already said it, I think it's conduct of conduct and I think specifically it has to do with decision-making, and for collective action. And because it's not about one person, right? It's governance, I mean, that's, know-thyself, right? So this is sort of a collective and, fundamentally it's about how you come to make decisions. That's what I think.

**Ellie Rennie:**

[35:32] I agree with that. And, it then becomes well, is corporate governance all we need for this new form of organization? And, my colleague, Sinclair Davidson actually has quite a nice paper on this, up on SSRN, arguing that corporate governance is sufficient. And I think in many instances, in many kinds of DAOs, it is probably sufficient. I think what we've all been also thinking about is what we've been calling informal governance and the types of social coordination that go beyond rules and how important they are within these systems. And to me, that is also governance, but that is more how the rules that we create, influence what we do and don't do even outside of that formal structure.

**Ellie Rennie:**

[36:35] And that's very, very clear to see within blockchain communities that they develop their own ways of working. And I think this becomes particularly important around you such as expertise and not just who is voting, but who is taking the lead within particular areas of a DAO. And how do we then start to recognize that, encourage that where it works and where it's useful for that organization, or find ways of shedding light on processes that are less ideal, particularly where decisions are occurring behind closed doors, in private Zoom calls, and then just pretending to be brought to the forum spontaneously in a democratic way?

**Eugene Leventhal:**

Josh, did you want to jump in?

**Joshua Tan:**

[37:42] Oh, sure. I guess I can go first. So I thought I'd give a definition that hopefully will make Zargham proud. It's a little bit that inconsistency. But the rough motto, the short version of that is, governance kind of writ small, is about control. So like sort of changing the behavior of systems. And governance writ large, following what Quinn mentioning, is about collective action. But kind of a way of thinking about this is that another way of sort of thinking about this is to say the governance writ small is really about the input-output behavior of systems. Right?

**Joshua Tan:**

But governance writ large, when we talk about collective action, it's also about systems, but it's really about what we might think of the local to global properties of systems. So if I have sort of a local system over here, and then I sort of compare this or sort of gluing this together with other pieces. Locally, the system might have some sort of property where preference is, but what does that look like when I started gluing all these other pieces into a bigger whole? Does the preference information change? Things like that.

**Joshua Tan:**

[39:00] There's lots of questions that you can start to think about in this local to global context, but I'm just saying these are two very different ways of thinking about governance, and this kind of gives you a way of reasoning about the relationship between them, in the context of a single system.

**Michael Zargham:**

[39:15] I guess I'm last and then we can hand the floor to Richard. For me, governance is I tend to think of it, well, I'll start with the baseline that, Ellie gave before about, it's the structuring of the, I guess it was, the field of play. Or the structuring, the environment in which others interact within. I'm going to take it up a level from that though, and sort of point out that I like to see it as the full life cycle, all of the processes that go into the adaptive capacity of that field of play. In other words that we can imagine that this system, as it were, that that provides the rules and the players and the evolution of the system being played by the players has this outer feedback loop through which the game is also adapted or the structuring of the field is adapted.

**Michael Zargham:**

And so at least for me, I think about governance in terms of the adaptive capacity of that field of play in response to, or in resistance to, pressures from inside and outside. In other words, it has both, rigid and elastic components and in order to be a healthy system, it needs to be able to both stand-up and not change in the face of some perturbations, but also, and ideally not change in the face of attacks or vulnerabilities potentially, like prevention of those threats, but then it still needs the capacity to adapt or change in response to a sort of steady or slower pressure that basically says, "Hey, you're, you're out of place. We need to move a little bit."

**Michael Zargham:**

[40:54] And so having a little bit of materials, R&D in my early, early life, I think very much in these rigidity and elasticity of the structure and ensuring that it can stay steady on a sort of day to day reliability sense, but also retains that adaptive or elastic capacity to change when it doesn't, say suit the situation. So maybe a little weird way to come at it, but it's that whole process, not just the individual act of changing the thing.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

Richard, do you want to jump in?

**Richard Brown:**

[41:28] Sure. And that's a great point Zargham because we haven't dealt into resiliency yet. The capacity for governance ecosystem to survive unexpected inputs and that's going to be a big challenge in the future. But, I come at this problem from industry, and so my perspective on governance is far more mercenary, I think. And so the way that I've structured these things in the past and way I've consulted with other people is, first identifies precisely what outcome you're trying to maximize for, and then build backwards from there. So figuring out why you want an ecosystem or a DAO, and then model from that.

**Richard Brown:**

The specific pieces that are put together though, the tooling comes from, at least from a tech and protocol perspective, in the crypto space. You have a protocol, you have an outcome you're maximizing for, and you have a pool of resources which can contribute to that outcome. And you have a reciprocal relationship where you need to design systems that allow value to flow back down to the stakeholders in that system. So, assembling the crypto or the, I guess, governance primitives that allow that relationship to be created, in ideally a healthy and productive way. And so that's what the governance picture looks like from a purely industry perspective, I think.

**Michael Zargham:**

[42:55] Can I poke on this a bit too? I want to know who is you in this model because I think what's interesting about the way that you framed it, and I've certainly been sitting in this chair before you have a stakeholder from the set of stakeholders in the room with you asking for that advice. And my curiosity is whether there's a specific you, that you have in mind answering that question. And if not, what are the types of you's, so to speak that you've encountered?

**Richard Brown:**

[43:24] Sure. And generally, there's buckets of community. So I look at what is the thing that the group wants to maximize for, the people that are proposing the DAO want to maximize for? And what is the group of stakeholders? And what is the buy and sell-side? What reciprocal relationships can be created there? So there's DAOs that, they're branding exercises, essentially. They need to create a sense of community that want to give access. They want to give inclusion. They want people to feel heard, and in return they provide, excitement and engagement. That's one type of a DAO.

**Richard Brown:**

There are DAOs that are specifically designed where the stakeholders are now the custodians of that environment, of that common mission. And they're responsible for being educated and, holding equity or holding tokens, holding stake in that ecosystem. And, doing enough research to be able to manage it effectively. That's an entirely different DAO than an engagement DAO. And there's a whole host, that is a spectrum and the spectrum is almost infinite.

**Richard Brown:**

[44:30] And there are other DAOs that are focused on lifestyle businesses. And how do we all just align on a basic goal? An anime fansite could be a DAO. People sharing a common interest and, assigning responsibilities, providing value to that mission and, critically receiving value in return. And then once we establish what it is that the stakeholders want and what the organization wants and what their outcome they're trying to maximize for, then you begin to take, "Okay, well, then you're going to need a voting system. You're going to need this type of communication. You need to determine consensus this way. You need to fight plutocracy, or you need to court plutocracy." The list goes on and on.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

Quinn, I saw you put your hand up first.

**Quinn Dupont:**

[45:20] I just wanted to pick up on sort of where Richard kind of left it off there and go back to Josh's description of this. I really like this small or large kind of notions of governance. I thought that was really helpful. And I think, so Rich is talking a lot about communities and I think in many respects, those are kinds of a small sense of governance. And that a DAO there, I think this is kind of an obvious point, but I think it's important to kind of put it out there and speak it out loud that a DAO is of course the system that allows us to structure that sort of Mason sociality or whatever. And so here, it's really important to think about the ways in which of course, the classic example of are we governing blockchains or are we using blockchain to govern or whatever, right?

**Quinn Dupont:**

There's that important distinction and that falls along these lines of this small and large. And the large, of course, that Josh was talking about includes these are these collective action types of problems, which includes, they have the properties of complex systems. And we already mentioned them, but I'll just kind of repeat them. We've got adaptive, emergent, non-linear, self-organizing, or kind of elastic types of properties. So, what's interesting is that those interact with the small, which are behaviors, right? And so for me, what I find fascinating about where the two interact is that behaviors and this game-type environment, that Zargham was talking about before, we have immense capability of structuring that environment.

**Quinn Dupont:**

[47:04] And here I'm reminded of good old classic B.F. Skinner's work on Beyond Freedom and Dignity, right? And there, when we start to think about the incredible importance of structuring that environment, we now all of a sudden have to shift our sense of responsibility from the individuals who come into it, right? The sense of that rich kind of sociality to the environment, and then who constructs the environment, how the rules that set up that environment. And so I think that's one of the places where maybe if we can, at some point kind of start talking responsibility and ethics where those relationships, I think, start to come to the floor, and it's in that interchange between complex systems that can sort of take care of themselves and the structuring environment in a very local kind of sense. Right?

**Eugene Leventhal:**

Ellie, did you want to jump in?

**Ellie Rennie:**

[48:05] Yes. I just want to, I suppose, anchor some of this discussion in some examples. So there's a DAO in formation that I've been observing, as a user of that which is DAppNode. Okay? It's a hardware service for people wanting to run nodes for various different blockchains. And they distribute machines and software and they do a fantastic job of it just as a not-for-profit service, essentially. I assume they're not for profit. And so they've launched into creating a DAO, distributing tokens to people who have been part of that ecosystem and users of their hardware, et cetera.

**Ellie Rennie:**

And it's been a really interesting thing because, and this is why I wanted to frame some of the conversation at the start, around the monitoring and this idea that once you have a successful blockchain-based community, which DAppNode certainly is, and it's using source cred for allocating useful contributions and it's Discord, et cetera. There seems to be this urge to become a DAO that occurs, which is how do we give people more stake? And in some ways that is literally more financial stake, because you then distribute a token, which may accrue value.

**Ellie Rennie:**

[49:33] Technically you could say that that's all people are in it for, and if you look at the discord, there are a million people saying, "I contributed 95 cents in a Gitcoin grant, therefore I should have some of this token." And I'm sure a lot of them are spammers, et cetera. So you start to have these self-interest dynamics going on that I think, these questions around why this urge to DAO, really useful and interesting to think about, which is for me, comes back to that we are working on AC centralized platforms, and there is a kind of ethic of participation that is occurring, which I think is important to pay attention to.

**Ellie Rennie:**

[50:16] But then we also have things like fan DAOs, which Richard mentioned, which I think are really interesting because they're resolving really deep problems in the creative economy where social media has actually become, a bit of a dead zone for artists in a way that it didn't used to be, MySpace was actually pretty good as a forum for enabling musicians to communicate with their fans directly and give rewards and all of that.

**Ellie Rennie:**

Now that Facebook has changed how they do things and Twitter is not as useful, they're still looking for different ways to directly liaise with fans. And so these actually just have a simple utility as well. And I think that the utility of DAOs is something which will continue to increase as other parts of, our centralized digital infrastructures, get closed off, or become more highly moderated or just more difficult to navigate, even in terms of advertising and communications automation structures that sit at the backend. So it's also just about people being able to do what they want to do. And that is important too.

**Michael Zargham:**

[51:34] I kind of want to riff on that a little bit around the challenge of an organization that grows beyond a certain scale too. So, the first example that you gave with DAppNode, and I think this is probably true of a decent number of relatively, let's say small to medium-sized projects where, as you start to grow, if you were in a conventional sort of startup modality, you would end up needing to bring on and grow your company non-primary functions, right? Like you end up having more marketing and more operations and more support and more things other than the original sort of fabrication of the technology. The research and development, or sort of early, bootstrapping on the sort of, we'll call it on the productive innovation side.

**Michael Zargham:**

[52:24] And what ends up happening then, if you didn't come to that through a more traditional startup mode, then you as say, core team members, founders or even just original contributors are suddenly faced with the operational overhead and the functions that need to be fulfilled that came about as a result of your success. And you may have little or no interest in fulfilling them. And if you're not going to go in a sort of more traditional corporate scaling mode, then what do you do? Do you just stop? Do you say, "Nope, sorry, I'm not going to help you"? Or do you create a new structure that allows you to again, grow to meet those needs to fill those functions? And honestly, what other options do you actually have, especially if you're internet native? Even if you're not crypto native, if you're just, a-geographic.

**Richard Brown:**

[53:16] That raises a question that I actually wanted to ask this group too because Ellie touched on this with her nest of desks at the very beginning, you touched on this, where is there a cap on complexity? And smaller DAOs, basically it was just make a big committee. We're all on the same committee and we'll all vote together and it'd be great. But, there's an upper bound on the complexity of an organization that can get away with that, and Maker most recently decentralized itself semi-famously. And the way that it did that is it identified all 27 departments it takes to do Maker and make 27 different DAOs. And, does this group believe that there is an upper limit? Is there a scalability problem in the DAO space?

**Michael Zargham:**

[53:58] In practice? Or do you mean, what you just described effectively amounts to a fractal kind of typology or even ontology, depending on how you think about it? I don't see an issue with sort of infinite fractal scaling as long as there's subsidiarity amongst those things, but actually getting to the point where people can execute that kind of transition. I mean, I think just the knowledge, much less the experience to go through those kinds of transitions. I think more organizations will break down and succeed at least in the near term in an effort to go through that kind of transition.

**Quinn Dupont:**

[54:38] I would just add that this is a classic problem, right? This is why you have a firm. This is transaction costs. Just look at Williamson's work on this. And many DAOs I would, if I had to guess are much more closely aligned to a club model when it comes to thinking about them organizationally. And the reason why firms are created is to reduce transaction costs within. Because if you don't bring people sort of inside the firm, you have your transaction costs always having these externalities and it becomes very expensive, right? So that's why you construct a firm in the first place. So I think DAOs give you another slice into that challenging picture.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

Ellie, please.

**Ellie Rennie:**

[55:30] Yeah. I agree with that. Anyway, look, Zargham wanted to talk about governance surfaces and I think that's actually a really important thing, but I might kind of segue into that through this. I mean, when we're talking about maker DAO, we're talking about a stable coin and stable coins, the most notorious area for this debate around automation versus human direction. And of course, many of the fully automated stable coins have been spectacular disasters, but the efforts to do that has been incredibly interesting. And Zargham and I have debated this around whether that's just bad code and bad design, et cetera, et cetera, whether it's something more interesting going on there. But I mean, personally, I think the idea of, and I know Quinn kind of said this, that in firms or not-for-profits you have committees, I think the idea of nested DAOs and ways of, organizing who is inputting into what is incredibly important and just delegating is a little part of that.

**Ellie Rennie:**

[56:42] But we've got a whole history of organizational theory to be able to inform how DAOs may get better at achieving what they need to do. But I don't want to leave this topic of maybe automation is actually valuable. And I think my other metric of capacity, if you've got that, that merit in terms of the rest of this particular piece of software code and automation and including the math that goes into it, then the automation can be a very beneficial aspect. And the task for us, as people, as human actors within these systems, is to learn how to work with that. With that agent, with that bureaucrat automated thing in ways that are beneficial to us as a society. And that's what we're working through at the moment. But this is what the DAO experiment is so beautifully illustrating, but of course, it's occurring across many aspects of society, not just blockchain areas that we are trying to learn how to deal with automation.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

[58:04] And I wanted to follow up on the idea of kind of, what are some of the specific roadblocks towards trying to grow these types of systems and how much is it a personal development question of, we just need to each commit to learning or thinking differently about the role we play in certain systems or how we interact with them. Do you see it as something with more natural hard limits? Is there, like the whole Dunbar theory of how many people we can interact with, and we always have to just be, there's only so many people we can coordinate with at a time?

**Eugene Leventhal:**

[58:36] Or is the fundamental challenge may be related to the fact that in some of these DAOs there's anonymous actors and that throws a wrench into the kind of culture and informal versus formal, governance that can be built. And Zargham, before I pass it back to you to answer, I realized we haven't clearly articulated for the public, the informal versus formal. [58:57] So just to quickly define formal as anything that's actually codified by policies, procedures, rules written down somewhere, someone can point to something. Informal is much more socio-cultural things that are passed along with medically things, that just exist without necessarily needing to have a piece of paper to point to say, "That's the reason we're doing it." But yeah, Zargham, you want it to jump in?

**Michael Zargham:**

[59:19] Well, let me restate your question because I put my hand up in response. So you asked about the barriers or the sort of impediments and scaling. And one thing I want to point out is that I feel like a lot of people entered the crypto or DAO space, or just this emerging, we'll call it, cultural subspace in a very borderline reactionary way. They have really negative experiences with some aspects of the social and power structures, whether it's corporate or government or academia or you name it, somebody has had some encounter with the structures that they, you know the powers that be in the system that they've been living in and working in and interacting in. And there was a great opportunity posed by these new web three based spaces and a lot of others with similar feelings.

**Michael Zargham:**

But the tendency that I see is one of like nuking structure and treating everything as though it's flat and you get a kind of tyranny of structurelessness that comes from, or at least a lot of these organizations when they try to grow beyond their scale. Because they start off incubating in these very, very flat and again, wonderfully, often, easily achieving rough consensus, but as they grow, there's this issue where they can't scale in that same mode and people really reticent to take new structure, to introduce structure, even if that is not the way their old structures worked, they may need something. Like the description of make DAOs sort of departments, so to speak, is a way of saying, look, there's a bunch of functions that needed to be fulfilled in order to accomplish Maker. And if they don't get fulfilled, then Maker goes away.

**Michael Zargham:**

[1:01:04] So we can't pretend like this is going to be a big flat giant organization. We actually need some structure, and that structure isn't, "I'm in charge and you're not." That structure is, "We need to get these things done," and we can have teams of teams and even teams of teams, of teams and these sort of fractals where maybe in any particular layer, things are largely flat, but they still have authority and responsibility across key functions. And there's subsidiarity as you kind of move down to the more granular decisions and these kinds of patterns are still structure. In fact, you can often look at them, at least I like to look at them with biologic analogies or natural systems analogies, where you can find these kinds of fractal network patterns in the way information flows and those systems exist and respond and persist.

**Michael Zargham:**

And the reason I'm pushing on this is that I think that some of the boundaries to growth are artificial and they're a little bit in our heads because we're like, "Well, I don't want to go back to a structured thing." And just because you don't like the structures that you dealt with before, doesn't mean you don't need to look to develop the structures that you need to facilitate or enable the coordination to achieve whatever your collective ends are. And if you refuse structure, you're going to hit that wall. But if you, invite or collaborate to define the structure you need, you can scale it quite more.

**Richard Brown:**

[1:02:24] I don't want to get too contentious here, but this is one of my concerns that I've been sort of bubbling on for a while, is that you start off simple and collective and a co-op-y DAO-y. And then you realize that there's complexity, there's decision-making there's time considerations, time challenges. So you add complexity, you add sophistication, you assigned leadership and ownership and you split off into smaller groups. At what point does the thing that you have now, is it indistinguishable than the thing that you were trying to hide from in the first place? Haven't you just recreated a firm at that point? You touched on this at the very beginning too, and it was very astute that everybody wants the second way. They know that they don't want the thing that they have and maybe the DAO is the thing that will be something new. But is it leading back to the thing that we had?

**Michael Zargham:**

[1:03:15] Yeah. So that's a really good point. And by no means am I saying, "Oh, it's a panacea. Just keep making it more complex." Because in some ways, there are going to be real trade-offs. I think the main difference between what I'm saying now, and maybe the recreation of the firm, is what I will call, I don't know whether it's federalization is the right way to put it, or maybe it's really better thinking of it as like biologic mitosis. Most of the organizations that I work within, or the family of organizations of which I'm a contributor are all like, genetically related in the sense of contributors and codebases and people collaborating, but they actually share no shell.

**Michael Zargham:**

[1:03:59] Meaning there's no meta-organization, there's actually only social networks between them. And I'm talking about Commons Stack, Token Engineering Commons, the Token Engineering Academy, BlockScience itself, the CatGen open source project. There's no shell. And so one of the ways that the scaling of the efforts of the group of researchers that I've worked with the most, and actually that also includes direct contribution to OneHive and SourceCred and, way to think about this is that we avoid the problem that you're stating by not pretending like any of these things that have spawned from this weird mixed interaction of contributors is actually belonging to some meta entity. That would be the substitute for that large firm.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

And Quinn. I know you wanted to jump in.

**Quinn Dupont:**

[1:04:44] Yeah, thanks. Perhaps it's helpful to clarify, at least on a kind of a class distinctions around some of these costs that we're talking about, as these challenges of scaling, between a classic firm and something that's much more to DAO-like. And I think we can, if we parse through them, it's fairly obvious the ways in which, DAO can address these issues. And there's if you just go to Wikipedia, you see there's three basic categories, there's search and information costs, right? So, that would be how a firm, figures out how to bring a product to market. Well, we can understand how DAOs offer all sorts of a wide range of opportunities for coming up with good governance mechanisms. You'd be involved, vote on, "Okay, this is a great product, right?"

**Quinn Dupont:**

We can amplify these kinds of decision-makings through quadratic funding or some all sorts of fancy techniques. [1:05:43] Then there's bargaining and decision costs. And this is those externalities that when you interact with other organizations, of course, those have been in many respects, largely eliminated from the efficiency of the internet, but specifically around crypto and then policing enforcement costs. Well, that's also taken care of by the fact that we've got robust security systems here. Right? So some of those just kind of just disappear and then some offer us a range of interesting tools to be able to, further enhance those. I mean, that's just the first cut. There's lots of ways which we could break that down, but I think there's at least interesting parallels we can draw.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

And Josh, before I hand it over to you. I do just want to flag that we're unfortunately coming up on time shortly, and I do have one question to kind of a closeout on, but first let's hear from Josh.

**Joshua Tan:**

[1:06:39] Maybe just a quick response to Richard's question. Maybe like a hard-nosed focus on efficiency and costs comparing DAOs to firms in that way, I wouldn't say misses the point but is maybe not the direction we wanted to go down. If we want to emphasize, this is why DAOs might be a better choice than firms. Not necessarily because they're more efficient, where they achieve some sort of better pareto optimal sort of thing. But the ideological satisfaction or the philosophical satisfaction of participating in a community-oriented venture versus one which, profits and capital, which profits are sort of sorted to a set few number of figures right.

**Joshua Tan:**

[1:07:31] And DAOs just happen to be, one instantiation of this general pattern toward community that has been tried and tried and tried over and over again in human history. Usually, the observation is that it's not as efficient. Maybe this one will make the cut, maybe it won't. But I guess I'm saying sort of comparing it to the firm may not be the necessary comparison. Compare it to existing co-op structures and ask this is more efficient than those. Right? And if so, and not only is it more efficient from a cost or from a perspective, like a capitalist market economy, but also is it sort of feeding in, or does it generate as much of the sort of community sort of values or the sort of takeaways, the reasons why people participate in co-ops. Does it provide as much of those incentives and outcomes and sort of kind of experiences and relationships? And that's just off bat, and then maybe that's like a fairer comparison.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

And, Zargham, I'm sorry to ignore the raised hand here but just given the time constraints, we're absolutely going to want to have some follow-up discussions here. Because I feel like we're barely scratching the surface. I mean, from the holistic view to the cost associated to the role identity plays, to why people are DAOing in the first place, is it regulatory arbitrage? Is it power diffusion in the system? There's so many other topics that we can potentially kind of dive in on and I'm sure spend an hour just on those.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

[1:09:13] But I wanted to give everyone a chance to, as we wrap up, kind of mention what you see from your perspective as, either the main research question that you would like to see more communities actively digging into and asking or what do you just see or are most excited about seeing in the coming months as more DAO experimentation takes place in relation to real-world implementations of governance systems? So your choice of one of those two, but if we don't mind, let's just go around and give everyone a chance for some closing remarks on that note, and then we'll wrap up.

**Ellie Rennie:**

[1:09:53] So one of the questions that you posed to us that we didn't get to, which I think I will take this opportunity to raise and talk to that excites me is just this question of what is ethics in DAOs. And I don't necessarily like to use the term ethics in this context, but the concept of minimizing harm is a really important one. And, the old slogan, can't be evil. But I think, who stole that one? One of the Bitcoin-based groups, that it is absolutely applicable to conversations around DAOs and the ways that we're using software to put constraints around what people can and can't do. But also I think what it raises for me that I'm interested in is the capability of users to even know what they're interacting with.

**Ellie Rennie:**

So how you ensure kind of adequate, not just auditing but standardization and the benefits of that as these things start to take off and replicate, which is certainly underway. [1:11:05] I like the Vitalik's metaphor in a podcast recently, where he was talking about blockchain systems, it's about defending the sheep rather than hunting the wolves. So what are the defenses for users in DAOs that we need to be thinking of and concentrating on? And I think there's a long, long way to go in that respect. So it's more than usability. It's about robust, trusted infrastructures.

**Michael Zargham:**

[1:11:41] So I want to give my closing remarks to tag on from Ellie because I'm coming from a large-scale resource allocation, cyber-physical systems, engineering background. I mean, these are the questions that we all already ask with everything from, sort of power grids and transportation systems and like physical engineered infrastructures. And, there's actually an entire body for better or worse of historical efforts to build and maintain and govern infrastructure. And I think what we're discovering, at least I'm discovering, is that these, digital socioeconomic infrastructures are the same class of thing.

**Michael Zargham:**

They may have appeared in a way that we weren't expecting because they're not manufactured in physical space, but people rely on them, they both create opportunities and expose vulnerabilities. Governance of them is minimizing those vulnerabilities, it's adapting to threats for pairing things when they break, the essence of them is, related to the patterns of behavior they support and making sure that they're both viewed from the perspective of providing the benefits that they provide, but actually because they tend infrastructures, I mean, to be invisible and their attributes tend to be taken sort of for granted, it's extra important for the process of governance to be one of monitoring and maintenance and care and minimizing or mitigating vulnerabilities.

**Michael Zargham:**

And, I say this as someone who's formally trained as an engineer and who w[1:13:11] And, I say this as someone who's formally trained as an engineer and who went through engineering ethics courses, which are way more practical than philosophical ethics courses. They come down to basically, "Don't build stuff that's going to hurt people. Don't build stuff that's going to help people hurt people." I mean, actually, that's not the only way that it's phrased. I have a short article that goes over the actual tenants of engineering ethics, but to kind of riff off of Ellie, the nuts and bolts of it is that you're acting in the interest of the public good.

**Michael Zargham:**

And that you're putting that ahead of your personal interests, that of even the firm that you're working for, which for me stands in stark contrast to the corporate firms' structures where fiduciary duty sort of rules. And so the engineering, like the traditional professional institution of engineering, provides actually quite a lot of guidance and so much so that I find myself sometimes like pulling out my textbooks and being like, "Here, look, this is how we govern infrastructure, even if it's not quite phrased in those words."

**Ellie Rennie:**

I should say that Vitalik's comment was armoring the sheep, not defending the sheep, but little correction there, same thing.

**Joshua Tan:**

I guess I'll jump in next. [1:14:24] So I work on standards and infrastructure for different pieces of the internet beyond the blockchain. And maybe the research question I would pose to people kind of listening to this conversation, presumably related or interested in the blockchain ecosystem is, I guess in blockchain today, there seems to be a lot of conversations around, let's say DAO to DAO interoperability or cross-chain interoperability, or multi-chain applications, things like that. And as you were thinking about, interoperability in that context and sort of standards to support that or stroke integrators.

**Joshua Tan:**

Maybe one question I'd ask is, [1:15:15] how do we support not only like DAO to DAO interop, or chain to chain interop, but DAO to any other form of social organization that already exists on the internet is probably much more prevalent, much more dominant, right? Ask yourself, right now blockchain is a very niche industry. So how does it engage with the rest of the internet and how do you start supporting that kind of work and those kinds of interactions? And I guess for me, what kind of standards would you build to support them?

**Quinn Dupont:**

I guess I'll go. [1:15:58] I started with Foucault and I guess I'll end with Foucault, maybe that telling, I don't know. But I really do think, like Zargham and Ellie I'm also animated by both the opportunities for social responsibility. We all face big collective action problems that, look, they're really important. And I think that having DAOs and blockchain governance, as a set of tools offers us really interesting opportunities. [1:14:41] But the thing is, are we talking about governance or are we talking about governmentality? Governmentality, classic Michel Foucault term. He describes it as, and I'm going to read a little passage.

**Quinn Dupont:**

"By governmentality, I understand the ensemble formed by institutions, procedures, and analyses and reflections calculations and tactics that allow the exercise of a very specific, albeit very complex power that has population as its target, political economy as its major form of knowledge and apparatuses of security as its essential technical instrument." Sounds to me like we just described blockchain. So Michel Foucault does not say that this is bad or wrong or evil, but rather that it's dangerous. That's an important distinction. And I think that's one that is just really important to think about that we're dealing with powerful, dangerous technologies here. They're not bad, but they're definitely dangerous.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

[1:17:42] Well, thank you all. I mean, this was such a fascinating conversation and I know we're very excited to figure out the ways to continue this conversation, both individually with everyone, but also for the public benefit. So again, I do just want to thank you all for taking the time to share your work and your thoughts today. And for those who do want to continue the conversation, feel free to check out [smartcontractresearch.org](http://smartcontractresearch.org/), where we're going to have a dedicated post to this panel. We'll link to work of every one of the panelists.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

And we will also include information on how to get in touch, where you can learn more about all of their work, all their research, all the active projects that they're working on, and we'll also include some general information that was touched on and maybe link to some of the general articles and more recent discussions that I know some of the panelists have more broadly been part of. And we're definitely very excited to keep the dialogue going here. And again, just thank you to everyone. And I hope you get to enjoy the rest of this summit.
