# Innovation Post Template

The Innovation Post template is used to share industry projects or ideas [on the forum](https://www.smartcontractresearch.org/).

By contributing you get:

* Access to a community of web3 experts, architects, and researchers
* Constructive feedback and awareness
* A dedicated space for long-tail discussions of your project or idea long after you post  

_If you are interested in posting about academic research instead, please consider using the [Research Summary template](https://github.com/smartcontractresearchforum/docs/blob/main/en/content_research_summary_template.md)._

## General Template

### TLDR

* Using a few bullets, provide an overview of the post.
* You can introduce the problem area, highlight notable findings, or write something that would make people curious enough to stop scrolling and dig into the post.

### Background

Share the motivation behind the project or idea, and provide information to get general readers up to speed.

Consider:

* The origin of the question or idea in this post.
* What excites you about this project or idea?
* Context needed to understand the problem
* Notable endeavors already explored in the field.
* Key terminology that may help people understand any technical nuances.

### Core Problem

In a sentence or a short paragraph, summarize the core problem that the project or idea is looking to solve. 

### Solution to the Problem

In this section, provide a tentative answer to the core problem. Put forth the perspective with adequate supporting materials.

Think about:

* How does the project or idea address the core problem?
* How does the project impact the space?
* What are challenges to building or implementing the project or idea?
* What are externalities or drawbacks of the project/idea, and how can they be offset?
* Support your thesis with data, examples, or evidence.

### Further Reading

Include links for further reading. You can choose to provide a brief description of each link.

## Before Posting

* Do not shill or copy-paste marketing language into the discussion post. Focus on the problem and how the project or idea serves as an interesting solution.
* The template is structured to highlight what needs to be answered in a logical post.
