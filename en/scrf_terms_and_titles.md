# SCRF Terms and Titles

The [Smart Contract Research Forum](https://www.smartcontractresearch.org/) (SCRF) has outlined a SCRF Glossary of Terms and Titles to be used when referring to SCRF concepts. The use of proper terms allows us to remain consistent, transparent, and authentic.

## Why this document exists

* Build and frame culture at SCRF
* Present a clear path to greater responsibility
* Provide clarity about the onboarding process
* Clear up roles and responsibilities; i.e. who is responsible for what
* Reinforce the importance of onboarding and community building

## Titles

The titles refer to how we designate and distinguish membership and role levels at SCRF. These are based on an individual's area and level of contribution and responsibility.

### Vertical Membership

Vertical Membership refers to areas of the company that individuals are directly contributing to and supporting.

**Content**: A Contributor or above who is directly supporting Content efforts in research pulse, primary author outreach, and/or the content pipeline.

**Engagement**: A Contributor or above who is directly supporting Engagement efforts in moderation, onboarding, and/or community engagement.

**Discovery**: A Contributor or above who is directly supporting Discovery efforts across branding, media, and/or marketing.

**Outreach**: A Contributor or above who is directly supporting Outreach efforts such as planning events and/or assisting outreach efforts.

**Operations**: A Contributor or above who is directly supporting Operations efforts such as general operations, finances, HR, grants, and/or special projects.

### Role Levels

The Role Levels refer to how we designate and distinguish membership at SCRF, which is based on an individual's level of contribution and responsibility.
