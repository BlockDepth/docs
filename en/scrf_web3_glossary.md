# SCRF Web3 Glossary

The [Smart Contract Research Forum](https://www.smartcontractresearch.org/) (SCRF) has created a glossary of web3 terminology to help introduce users to the field and facilitate better forum  navigation.

The glossary does not aim to encompass all of web3 terminology. Instead, it is intended primarily as a companion for users of the forum. Definitions are taken from reputable online sources, which are linked for further reading. Follow relevant discussions on the forum for most terms by using the Forum Tags.

## Glossary Terms

The glossary currently hosts more than fifty definitions of commonly used Web3 terminology in blockchain, crypto, and technological fields.
