# SCRF Weekly Community Calls

The [Smart Contract Research Forum](smartcontractresearch.org) (SCRF) hosts weekly community calls that are open to everyone. SCRF may use the time to meet new members, catch up on the latest news, talk about active projects at SCRF, or discuss new research proposals. Weekly community calls are summarized in the #[general](https://discord.com/channels/784234332617048065/784234333111451670) channel. Please note, while SCRF encourages participation in community calls, attendance is voluntary and is therefore unpaid.
