## SCRF Research Pulse Weekly Newsletter

The Smart Contract Research Forum (SCRF) Discovery Team created this document to pitch and outline strategy for the creation of a weekly Research Pulse newsletter, with the goal of amplifying consequential research in the Web3 space.

### Project Vision

The goal for this project is to create a valuable SCRF asset to circulate important Web3 research and ecosystem information to target audiences. The pilot for accomplishing this goal is to translate the content format of the Research Pulse, which is currently shared as a set of weekly socials posts that link information back to individual weekly features housed on the [Research Pulse category](https://www.smartcontractresearch.org/c/post-ideas/research-pulse/26) of the forum, into a weekly e-newsletter. There has been a lot of positive feedback on the Research Pulse itself from industry players, and an emailed newsletter has the potential to better contextualize the Research Pulse items and foster further discussion than the current socials do alone.

### Project Benefits

* **Content:** The newsletter provides an opportunity for the Discovery Team to Collaborate with the Content Team to ensure we showcase the latest and greatest Web3 research and information, which allows us to continue to provide value and incentives to Researchers and Industry actors to contribute to SCRF. The Content Team is already creating the bulk of the content that will populate this newsletter, so the barrier to entry is relatively low compared to typical new projects. The e-newsletter presentation can include a better visual hierarchy than is possible within Twitter and LinkedIn, which have platform-based restrictions on character count, data viz, etc.
* **Engagement**: The newsletter can help foster greater engagement on the forum, as it will provide direct traffic to the forum, encourage calls to action to discuss forum content, and help cultivate a dedicated Web3 community.
* **Discovery:** As an initiative driven by the Discovery Team, the Research Pulse newsletter will serve as one of the many communication tools within our strategic discovery plan for expanding our audience, creating awareness, and learning how our audience prefers to interact with forum content.
* **Outreach:** The Research Pulse Newsletter will provide knowledge and resource-sharing across the ecosystem. The project is directly tied to learning networks since it is a tool for providing information to all of the players involved in our space.
* **Operations**: The newsletter has the potential to serve as a networking tool to facilitate future partnerships by helping to build out the top of the discovery funnel

### Goals and Objectives

The goal of this project is to further amplify consequential, well-sourced research within the Web3 space for industry constituents via weekly, direct email communications. The call to action for readers is to click through to the Research Pulse sections of the forum for the weekly research discussions. Success is defined and measured based on quantitative data, including click-through rates and page referrals, as well qualitative data, such as reader feedback and interaction on the forum.

The weekly Research Pulse has proved to be an engaging feature within our socials platforms, especially LinkedIn. It has an even greater capacity for engagement via a direct email communication, which is more personal, enjoys different weight, and has more design flexibility than our socials channels.
