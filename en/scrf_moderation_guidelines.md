# Forum Moderation Guidelines

The [Smart Contract Research Forum](https://www.smartcontractresearch.org/) (SCRF) has created a Moderator Workflow to provide moderators with guidelines to ensure comments and posts on the forum align with SCRF's standards.

## Overview

Moderators should reference this document when evaluating forum content. The Moderator Workflow details initial responses to forum notifications, content analysis, proper courses of action, and plan implementations.

## Process

### Step 1 - Notification

This section covers the initial actions required once moderators receive notifications on the forum.

* Check the #forum-notifications channels in chat to see if there are new contributions to the forum. These notifications are to be claimed by a moderator within one business day.
* The first moderator to reach a post indicates that they will take action by using the :pencil2: reaction.
* Please note, when a moderator claims a post, they are obliged to take one of the actions described below.

### Step 2 - Identification

Once a moderator has claimed a post or comment, it should be prioritized according to severity, source, and type as defined below.

#### Severity

<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Priority</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Severity</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Description</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>1
   </td>
   <td>

:heavy_exclamation_mark: (Red)
   </td>
   <td>Content is detractive in some manner. It may be factually incorrect, rude, discourteous, and/or violates our <a href="https://hackmd.io/9NgehLoXS--WU6ZSW6K2gg">community ethos</a> in some manner. This would also include persistent and belligerent responses to prior moderation efforts.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>2
   </td>
   <td>

:warning: (Yellow)
   </td>
   <td>Content has detractive qualities but also appears to be a good faith attempt to contribute to the community. Moderators should consider this classification over a :heavy_exclamation_mark: (Red) classification for new contributors to the forum as a way to socialize their contributions and share our <a href="https://hackmd.io/9NgehLoXS--WU6ZSW6K2gg">community ethos</a>.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>3
   </td>
   <td>

:star: (Star)
   </td>
   <td>Content is high quality and thoughtful. This should be reserved for content that would be worth showcasing externally.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>4
   </td>
   <td>

:green_book: (Green)
   </td>
   <td>Content is well written, contains strong content, and is within our <a href="https://hackmd.io/9NgehLoXS--WU6ZSW6K2gg">community ethos</a>.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

Type

<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Priority</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Type</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Description</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>1
   </td>
   <td>Post
   </td>
   <td>Full-length posts to the forum are slightly higher priority.

  <tr>
   <td>2
   </td>
   <td>Comment
   </td>
   <td>Short-form comments on existing threads are slightly lower priority.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Step 3 - Action

Moderators should first determine the proper course of action and then follow the steps outlined below to implement the action plan.

<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Range of Actions</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Recommended Use</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Delete Content
   </td>
   <td>Generally not recommended. Use for extreme violations of community ethos or when the content is clearly spam.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Edit Content Directly
   </td>
   <td>Generally not recommended. Use for fixing glaring typos or fixing clearly broken links. It is recommended that the original author be informed before making direct edits.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Temporarily Hide and Message Author
   </td>
   <td>Recommended for :heavy_exclamation_mark: (Red) content.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Respond and Correct in Thread
   </td>
   <td>Recommended for :warning:
 (Yellow) and content. Use this when there is a genuine content effort, but it does not meet the quality standards or tone in the <a href="https://hackmd.io/9NgehLoXS--WU6ZSW6K2gg">community ethos</a>.
<p>
For a "thanks" post
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Ignore Comment
   </td>
   <td>Recommended if yellow but just a "thanks type post"
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>DM Author and Correct
   </td>
   <td>Recommended for :warning:
 (Yellow) content. Use this when the content's tone is ambiguous, the quality is difficult to decipher, or prior experience with the author indicates that correction in private will have a greater impact.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Like Post
   </td>
   <td>Recommended for :green_book:
 (Green) content.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Respond and Encourage in Thread
   </td>
   <td>Recommended for :green_book: (Green) and :star:
 (Star) content. Use this to not only encourage additional contribution by the author of the topic or post and also to move the thread toward an actionable takeaway or a unique question or problem identification.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Respond and Connect to another positive contributor
   </td>
   <td>Recommended for green and we want them to also talk to another person who typically does green level content
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Nominate for Comment of the Month
   </td>
   <td>Recommended for  :star:
 (Star) quality posts and strong :green_book:
 (Green) quality posts.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Share/Pin Post
   </td>
   <td>Reserved for :star:
 (Star) quality posts.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Reward
   </td>
   <td>Reserved for users with many green or star
<ul>

<li>Engagement grant offer

<li>Moderation team tip

<li>Reputation reward in Discord
</li>
</ul>
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

* Select the appropriate action using the logic defined in this workflow document.
* If there is uncertainty on what action to take, use the #moderation channel in chat to explain the uncertainty so that other moderators can help.
* Use the #moderation channel to make the following types of requests as well:
  * **Review:** the moderator prefers a fellow moderator or researcher to review the comment for accuracy.
  * **Assist:** the moderator needs a fellow moderator or researcher to do the commenting instead because it is beyond their technical understanding or there are members in the SCRF team that have the greater community weight needed in this situation; tagging someone that could help is recommended.

### Step 4 - Follow Up

* If the author of a post or comment responds positively to moderation, treat that content as a regular incoming moderation notification. In addition, the moderator may want to acknowledge the improvement in tone or quality of the post or comment, if deemed appropriate.
* If poor quality persists, or the author becomes aggressive when being moderated:
  * Discuss in #moderation channel
  * Ignore "likes"
  * Ignore responding with comment until a specific strategy is created as a result of discussion in #moderation channel
* Actions available if disruptive behavior persists:
  * Propose creating a separate thread to isolate the bad actor
  * Engage in DM discussion
  * Potentially ban/silence. This is a last resort and should be carefully considered in consultation with the moderation team.

### Step 5 - Curation

* Refer to the [Discussion Summary Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OBFHVezq8WBAIzx-cbq8tZdS-_W5UKPv5wf2QnTSKk0/edit#heading=h.husueveqa7bj)
