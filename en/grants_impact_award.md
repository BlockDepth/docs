# SCRF Impact Award

The [Smart Contract Research Forum](https://www.smartcontractresearch.org/) (SCRF) has created the Impact Award to honor researchers whose work represents exceptional achievement, particularly in underappreciated or novel areas of blockchain research.

## Overview

The SCRF Impact Award recognizes researchers who are contributing valuable work to the ecosystem. Impact Award grants are announced on SCRF’s [forum](smartcontractresearch.org) every month.

## Eligibility

Researchers whose work is featured in a [Research Pulse](https://www.smartcontractresearch.org/tag/research-pulse), [Research Summary](https://www.smartcontractresearch.org/tag/summary), or showcased in some other interaction on SCRF’s forum are eligible for recognition as a part of this program.

## Compensation & Logistics

Award recipients will receive a $1,000 allocation in recognition of their contributions. SCRF issues funds in cryptocurrency. Follow the steps outlined in "[How to Get Compensated for Work](https://github.com/smartcontractresearchforum/docs/blob/main/en/content_how_to_get_compensated_for_work.md)" to claim the _REWARD/AWARD/BOUNTY_after SCRF has announced the recipients.
