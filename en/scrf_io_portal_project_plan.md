# SCRF.io Portal Project Plan

The [Smart Contract Research Forum](https://www.smartcontractresearch.org/) (SCRF) is creating a website to help different stakeholders navigate SCRF. This document serves as the project plan to help support the strategic and logistical elements surrounding the creation of SCRF's website.

## Project Vision

The SCRF website can be a home for people to find out about SCRF, learn about the projects taking place across the organization, and cohesively bring all of the properties together in one place. The vision is to have a place where people can find what they are looking for, understand how to contribute, and what value SCRF can bring.

## Project Benefits

SCRF has several disparate properties (Forum, GitHub) and channels (Discord, Twitter, Youtube, LinkedIn, Facebook), but no central, cohesive space for people to find out about SCRF. With a central, public site, we can help people find relevant resources and devise a system to augment and iteratively add properties or channels over time.
* **Content:** With a website portal, individuals can easily discover the best SCRF content without disrupting the forum. It also allows SCRF to showcase the most relevant content, which can assist with further content creation efforts.
* **Engagement:** A focused website is vital for community building and onboarding efforts. The portal can be a great de-facto place for anyone wanting to connect with SCRF - contact forms, streamlined forum registration, calendar of events, etc.
* **Discovery:** The portal will be a great place to introduce a new layer of taxonomy onto the deep content of SCRF that is more appropriate for public digestion and marketing. A newcomer to SCRF can easily get frustrated attempting to find relevant information, whether on the forum or elsewhere. Searching on the portal is curated and tailored which leads to quality content. SCRF.io can be broad to include GitHub, selected areas of the forum, and other resources. 
* **Outreach:** A dedicated space that helps showcase and explain SCRF can help with outreach efforts. Events and other community-facing activities can use the SCRF.io domain to drive traffic organically. 

## Goals and Objectives

The website project intends to create a space where people can easily discover what is happening at SCRF and find the information they are seeking.

* Learn about SCRF and showcase our value to the ecosystem
  * Content repository of SCRF's best hits - summaries, discussions, wins, grant winners, comment of the month, etc.
  * Mine the forum for important ref materials and compile curated content for the site
* Allow for different audiences to find relevant information
  * Ensure different personas know where to go and how to connect with SCRF
  * Develop clear CTAs
* Unified Search
  * Make information more readily discoverable in a centralized location with unified search functionality. Search on the portal should not lead to deep results directly to forum content but rather surface the curated content. The forum is still directly searchable and it is possible to show on SCRF.io.
  * Unified search will combine all data stores such as GitHub, calendar, information hosted on the forum, into a single search. This will allow anyone to just ask SCRF.io what they are looking for and get a fairly intelligent result. Implementation will use the REST APIs provided by each vendor.
* Brand Consistency
  * Brand consistency can be further reinforced by the user of the SCRF.io domain as a URL shortener.scrf.io/forum scrf.io/discord scrf.io
* Showcase Legitimacy and Collaborate w SCRF

## Measures of Success and Analytics

Important:

* Overall traffic aka number of visitors and the source
* Average time on the site plus the bounce rate
* Basic site reqs - fully responsive site, etc.

TBD:

* Conversions - what do these look like? Perform an activity vs Sign up
  * Track the funnel
  * Drive people into the chat to be onboarded
    * People contributing to SCRF and deriving value

Nice to Have:

* Site Speed - not optimized, but high usability
* Keyword rankings - not a priority
  * Low lift - metadata, etc.

## Target Audience(s)

SCRF serves different audiences, which help pave the way to determining the content and composition of the site.

* Research
  * Academia (Students, Faculty, Uni Labs), Independent Researchers, Uni Labs
    * How to contribute and collaborate w SCRF aka grants, awards, proposals
* Practitioners
  * Early Stage Teams - sample mandates, frameworks, case studies, reference materials (taxonomy, notable works, audit DBs, reading list, etc.)
    * Host other teams' materials
