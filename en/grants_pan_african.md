# SCRF Pan-African Micro-Grant Program

The [Smart Contract Research Forum (SCRF)](https://www.smartcontractresearch.org/) has created the Pan-African Micro-Grant Program to provide micro-grants to the students and alumni of African universities.

## Overview

The Pan-African Micro-Grants Program is the first of SCRF’s regional grants efforts, focusing initially on Western Africa. The program’s goal is to extend micro-grants to academics and researchers to write [Research Summaries](https://www.smartcontractresearch.org/tag/summary) based on African academic papers or regional blockchain case studies.

From early adoption of solar power to mobile phone usage and mobile payments, Africa has a long history of technological “leapfrogging.” The continent has proven time and again that it is capable of radical technical innovation and developing nations in the region are perfectly positioned to leapfrog the legacy financial system through the widespread adoption of blockchain. Yet, these developments remain largely unknown outside of Africa.

Through this program, SCRF aims to publish a steady stream of public and open African-focused research that may not be available to the broader crypto community.

## Eligibility

Graduate and undergraduate students are eligible for participation as a part of this program. Academics, researchers, and industry participants are also welcome to apply. Applicants should be affiliated with an African university, or be from an African country studying abroad.

## How to Qualify

Applicants should have interest and insights into blockchain technologies and be comfortable with writing Research Summaries or Use Case examinations.

To be considered for this grant, first, submit an [application](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSewBrQY-0X2Iawgyvq4pgPhGgiCv2ZnoKBSKfmTljSV3KeaLg/viewform). Upon approval, complete a Research Summary or Use Case examination within four weeks. During this time,  researchers are expected to attend regular check-in meetings.

SCRF may offer long-term opportunities to successful grantees and ask them to submit additional grant applications.

## Compensation & Logistics

Grant recipients will receive $300 to write a single Research Summary or Use Case examination.

SCRF pays in cryptocurrency. For longer commitments, alternative arrangements can be made. Follow the steps outlined in "[How to Get Compensated for Work](https://github.com/smartcontractresearchforum/docs/blob/main/en/content_how_to_get_compensated_for_work.md)" to claim the grant__after SCRF has announced the recipients.

If unable to accept funds directly, alternative options could include:

* Funding a project
* Conference travel
* Charitable donations to an endowment
* Credits for compute resources, archive nodes, etc.
* Direct support of a blockchain-related organization or event of choice
