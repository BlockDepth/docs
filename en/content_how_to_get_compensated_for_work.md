# How to Get Compensated for Work

The [Smart Contract Research Forum](http://smartcontractresearch.org) (SCRF) created a 'How to Get Compensated for Work' guide to help SCRF contributors navigate the payment system.

## Overview

This document covers how to create an invoice, track hours, alternative payment methods, and important notes. Recently onboarded contributors and recipients of grants, awards, or rewards need to follow the steps below to receive compensation.

## Invoicing and Payment System

SCRF officially pays invoices at the end of each month, after the work has been performed and billed. In certain situations, SCRF may process another round of payments mid-month. **All invoices are due five full business days before the end of the month. Please submit your hours for approval before submitting your invoice.**

Any billable hours for the month that were forgotten or performed after the invoice was submitted can be added to the next invoice with a description. SCRF uses Request Network for all payments.

How to get set up:

* Use an Ethereum wallet address (SCRF recommends [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) but any wallet is acceptable)
* Create an account on [Request Network](https://app.request.finance/login).

To submit a Request invoice:

1. Choose DAI for invoice currency.
2. Select DAI stablecoin as the payment cryptocurrency.
3. Add a new client using the email address invoice@scrf.io.
4. Complete further details with the following information:

   1250 Broadway
   36th Fl
   10001 New York
   
5. Provide full name and chat username in the memo field.
6. Attach a copy of [Your Name] [Hours Template Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pXZlO_mxAbKQ-0gifylb2chdUuU3OniBWllryJ48RAM/edit?usp=sharing) or provide a link to the sheet.
    * For anyone submitting bounties, it is not required to submit hours but please include a link to your submission.
7. Submit the invoice for payment.

## Tracking Hours

Anyone submitting bounties or non-hours-based grants can ignore this step. Anyone else working for SCRF is expected to track their hours using the template sheet and process outlined below:

* Make a copy of the [Hours Template Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pXZlO_mxAbKQ-0gifylb2chdUuU3OniBWllryJ48RAM/edit?usp=sharing) and title it '[Your Name] Hours'
* Track time worked in 30-minute increments on the spreadsheet copy
* Provide a detailed description of work completed for each line item
* Submit or share your hours with your supervisor for approval before you submit your invoice 

## Compensation and Logistics

If unable to accept funds directly, alternative compensation options may include:

* Funding a project
* Conference travel
* Charitable donations to an [endowment](https://thegivingblock.com/donate/)
* Credits for compute resources, archive nodes, etc.
* Direct support of a blockchain-related organization or event of choice

Key reminders:

* Participation in community calls, events, and cohorts are not billable
* Invoices are due five full business days before the end of each month
* Check the chat for any announcements such as holidays that impact the invoice due date
* The pay rate varies according to the complexity and time requirements of assignments
* Only submit one invoice per billing cycle, even if both hourly and grant work was completed
* Group payments together from multiple bounties
